       " 'it would be tempting to dismiss superman returns with a cursory he should not have bothered certainly for all the noble intentions it s the most misconceived blockbuster in years at times misjudging its audience more than any mega budget film since speed 2 on paper it sounds so promising ignoring the last two superman films and following on from superman ii as if they never happened throwing marlon brando back in the mix via archive footage and bringing the man of steel back to earth after an absence of several years during which people have begun to question whether they even need him anymore and after bryan singer s success with the first two x men films he d seem the perfect director yet the end result is one of the most disappointingly dull and relentlessly glum movies of the century and certainly one of the grottiest looking major studio films ever it s at once one of those films that manages to look both expensive and cheap you can see where money has been spent but it never really counts if anything it looks like a busted bloated miniseries all buildup but precious little payoff what we get instead is endless brooding yet the relentlessly oppressive look of the film is merely a symptom of a far greater malaise where donner mixed sorrow with joy and exuberance singer just gives us naval gazing as his superman spends far more of the movie brooding brooding and then brooding some more not even finding any satisfaction in the few feats of heroism he performs indeed they should have changed the tagline to you ll believe a man can brood as he mopes his way through much of the agonisingly long 154 very long minutes he hardly even flies he just hovers around wallowing in wistful self pity forever before we finally get half an hour of decent action before its back to the misery albeit somewhat more effective than the dreary first half the film is often genuinely monotonous in the dictionary sense of the word there s no sense of pace or narrative economy no joy of discovery no eagerness to see what happens next just an unexciting trudge through the superhero s angst as he endlessly hovers around worse this is a film with no sense of wonder at all where the donner films worked was their ability to juggle loss emotion a sense of wonder and joy and exuberance with reeve you got the impression that superman enjoyed using his powers to do good but here it s nothing but a cross to bear in a series of even more bleedin obvious than the passion of the christ metaphors look there s supes being crucified look there s supes being scourged and look on the third day the tomb is empty and he has risen yet for all the time spent on would be character building scenes even by the half hour point we know surprisingly little and care less about the characters so that when superman finally goes into action in a well conceived but strangely unexciting shuttle rescue it carries no real weight only kevin spacey seems to be bringing anything to the party his lex luthor dominating the film far more than should be good for it as he sets about his latest real estate scam at great length on the side of good brandon routh fares better as clark kent than as superman his weak voice combining with a poor sound mix to make the man of steel sound distinctly wimpier than the mild mannered reporter kate bosworth does her best with lois lane but the character goes through the film with such a huge chip on her shoulder it s impossible to warm to her despite her best efforts hell you know a film s in trouble when james marsden makes the most impression and it all looks so grotty all the time with the limitations of the video photography robbing even close ups of detail some shots of superman s face look more like a final fantasy computer simulation than a real person limiting the color scheme superman s costume usually looks turquoise or green here and seemingly limiting the action to clumsy tight shots that limit the film s scale even basic no brainer shots are simply botched hard to believe but even the would be iconic shot of clark ripping off his shirt to reveal well just a little bit of blue vest actually flops because the shot misses the iconic s logo entirely as if the film was framed for fullframe tv instead of widescreen nor are the well intentioned nods to the donner films successful the brando footage after the first scene seem more gimmick than anything else with lines thrown in almost at random to no effect whatsoever it even rehashes huge chunks of other characters dialogue from the first film showing up just how short some of the players fall routh seems almost apologetic when delivering the flying is still statistically speaking the safest way to travel bit while parker posey does her best with valerie perrine s cast off wisecracks although they re talking about adding more action for the proposed sequel that s really not the solution the 1978 film probably had less action than this but it counted because we were involved with and liked the characters you wanted him to rescue lois from the helicopter whereas this time round you could not care less if the surly cow burned up in the shuttle scene or not as an introduction to her as well it s incredibly poor what this needs is characters we like and can root for not bigger set pieces as it stands hell even fantastic four was a more successful superhero flick than this it s as if someone decided to film lois lane s editorial why the world does n t need superman looks like supe s fatal flaw is not kryptonite it s bryan singer still it could have been worse it could have been brett ratner the extras on the 2 disc set are good and at least highlight the sincere intentions behind this misfire but it s hard to muster up the enthusiasm to watch them throughout after seeing the film especially since the expensive krypton prolog is not included in the deleted scenes being held back for a future special edition in what seems a particularly cynically commercial move the transfer of the feature is okay but the limitations of the original digital photography are often very apparent meaning that it frequently looks worse than the first two films made more than a quarter of a century ago',\n",

misjudging its audience more than any mega budget film since speed 2 on paper it sounds so promising ignoring the last two superman films and following on from superman ii as if they never happened throwing marlon brando back in the mix via archive footage and bringing the man of steel back to earth after an absence of several years during which people have begun to question whether they even need him anymore and after bryan singer s success with the first two x men films he d seem the perfect director yet the end result is one of the most disappointingly dull and relentlessly glum movies of the century and certainly one of the grottiest looking major studio films ever it s at once one of those films that manages to look both expensive and cheap you can see where money has been spent but it never really counts if anything it looks like a busted bloated miniseries all buildup but precious little payoff what we get instead is endless brooding yet the relentlessly oppressive look of the film is merely a symptom of a far greater malaise where donner mixed sorrow with joy and exuberance singer just gives us naval gazing as his superman spends far more of the movie brooding brooding and then brooding some more not even finding any satisfaction in the few feats of heroism he performs indeed they should have changed the tagline to you ll believe a man can brood as he mopes his way through much of the agonisingly long 154 very long minutes he hardly even flies he just hovers around wallowing in wistful self pity forever before we finally get half an hour of decent action before its back to the misery albeit somewhat more effective than the dreary first half the film is often genuinely monotonous in the dictionary sense of the word there s no sense of pace or narrative economy no joy of discovery no eagerness to see what happens next just an unexciting trudge through the superhero s angst as he endlessly hovers around worse this is a film with no sense of wonder at all where the donner films worked was their ability to juggle loss emotion a sense of wonder and joy and exuberance with reeve you got the impression that superman enjoyed using his powers to do good but here it s nothing but a cross to bear in a series of even more bleedin obvious than the passion of the christ metaphors look there s supes being crucified look there s supes being scourged and look on the third day the tomb is empty and he has risen yet for all the time spent on would be character building scenes even by the half hour point we know surprisingly little and care less about the characters so that when superman finally goes into action in a well conceived but strangely unexciting shuttle rescue it carries no real weight only kevin spacey seems to be bringing anything to the party his lex luthor dominating the film far more than should be good for it as he sets about his latest real estate scam at great length on the side of good brandon routh fares better as clark kent than as superman his weak voice combining with a poor sound mix to make the man of steel sound distinctly wimpier than the mild mannered reporter kate bosworth does her best with lois lane but the character goes through the film with such a huge chip on her shoulder it s impossible to warm to her despite her best efforts hell you know a film s in trouble when james marsden makes the most impression and it all looks so grotty all the time with the limitations of the video photography robbing even close ups of detail some shots of superman s face look more like a final fantasy computer simulation than a real person limiting the color scheme superman s costume usually looks turquoise or green here and seemingly limiting the action to clumsy tight shots that limit the film s scale even basic no brainer shots are simply botched hard to believe but even the would be iconic shot of clark ripping off his shirt to reveal well just a little bit of blue vest actually flops because the shot misses the iconic s logo entirely as if the film was framed for fullframe tv instead of widescreen nor are the well intentioned nods to the donner films successful the brando footage after the first scene seem more gimmick than anything else with lines thrown in almost at random to no effect whatsoever it even rehashes huge chunks of other characters dialogue from the first film showing up just how short some of the players fall routh seems almost apologetic when delivering the flying is still statistically speaking the safest way to travel bit while parker posey does her best with valerie perrine s cast off wisecracks although they re talking about adding more action for the proposed sequel that s really not the solution the 1978 film probably had less action than this but it counted because we were involved with and liked the characters you wanted him to rescue lois from the helicopter whereas this time round you could not care less if the surly cow burned up in the shuttle scene or not as an introduction to her as well it s incredibly poor what this needs is characters we like and can root for not bigger set pieces as it stands hell even fantastic four was a more successful superhero flick than this it s as if someone decided to film lois lane s editorial why the world does n t need superman looks like supe s fatal flaw is not kryptonite it s bryan singer still it could have been worse it could have been brett ratner the extras on the 2 disc set are good and at least highlight the sincere intentions behind this misfire but it s hard to muster up the enthusiasm to watch them throughout after seeing the film especially since the expensive krypton prolog is not included in the deleted scenes being held back for a future special edition in what seems a particularly cynically commercial move the transfer of the feature is okay but the limitations of the original digital photography are often very apparent meaning that it frequently looks worse than the first two films made more than a quarter of a century ago',\n",

       " 'gran torino out of 5release date december 12th 2008running time 116 minutesrating rscreenplay nick schenkdirector clint eastwoodstarring clint eastwood bee vang ahney her christopher carley2008 was a great year in the legendary career of clint eastwood as he delivered two of the best films of his career with changeling and gran torino both of these movies were two of the very best of 2008 and i fail to understand how neither of these movies received a best picture nomination or best director if gran torino is eastwood s last acting gig he sure as hell went out with a bang with what just might be the best performance of his career gran torino is vintage eastwood he s made a career playing the tough guy and he is the last of the ultimate film tough guys with bronson and mcqueen no longer with us even in his late 70s clint can still pull the tough guy role off to perfection think of clint s character as maybe an older dirty harry in terms of the tough guy persona again even at his age you never doubt that he s still the ultimate tough guy and again this is vintage eastwood gran torino gets off to a solid start but there is not anything that really stands out but as the movie goes on it simply gets better and better and by the end of the movie i was blown away by how amazing of a movie this was and it had me in awe gran torino is an instant classic and one of the best movies in clint eastwood s career both as an actor and as a director the screenplay by nick schenk was slightly clich eacute d in some spots but overall it worked well with some truly great characters that are also very well developed which is something rare these days in hollywood gran torino may not have the perfect screenplay but it s a very good one the dramatic scenes play out well and there is also some comedy and both these elements really work very well like i said the characters are fleshed out and developed and all the main characters will get a reaction from the viewer so even if gran torino is slightly clich eacute d in spots nick schenk makes up for it with some truly great characters as director clint eastwood knocks it out of the park with a truly gripping and touching movie at first i was not really a big fan of eastwood s direction i never felt he was a poor director well outside of maybe the rookie which was a bit poor but i never felt he was a bad director but i never really got into his direction but over the years i have found a new appreciation for eastwood as a director and he s by far one of my favorite directors now what makes eastwood such a great filmmaker is his simplicity which can sometimes bring a filmmaker down but clint does not try and be flashy and simply tells the story gran torino again was truly gripping and touching eastwood hits all the right spots in terms of drama and comedy and really brings you into this world and makes you care for the characters the action sequences are brief but all pack a punch and are not overdone but done in a simple way that makes them all the more powerful it seems like the academy always nominates eastwood every chance they get but why he was snubbed for gran torino and changeling is beyond me gran torino is everything it s been made out to be and more as filmmakers get older normally they do not get better but clint is just as great now as he ever was and maybe in some ways better about the only real flaw one can find with gran torino is possibly the acting while none of the performances are terrible but some are a bit wooden clint eastwood is a great actor but he does not have a lot of range he pretty much plays a variation of the same character for the most part and by no means is that an insult eastwood is possibly the best at the role he plays outside of bronson and mcqueen nobody can play the tough guy like eastwood and i d say he s a better actor than bronson but sorry i d have to give mcqueen the edge but while clint may not have the most range he s still a fantastic actor but here with gran torino his performance was mind blowing in terms of acting i think unforgiven and gran torino were his two best as far as range goes as walt kowalski eastwood is funny sympathetic and very likeable eastwood shows a great deal of range and i truly believe an oscar nomination should have come his way making their film debuts are bee vang as thao and ahney her as sue and both actors show some potential bee vang does well and while his performance is by no means perfect and a little rough around the edges in some spots but he handles it well and his character was likeable again it was his film debut so you can not expect perfection but overall he does well even if a little stiff at times but since the character was likeable i ll give him the passing grade ahney her however steals the show with a really great and energetic performance and what she has going for her is charisma each scene ahney was in she really lit up the screen and brought a lot of fun to the character gran torino was no doubt one of the best movies of 2008 and eastwood s performance is one of the best if not the best of his career despite some clich eacute s gran torino works on every level and is a must see for all eastwood fans the blu ray release for gran torino was simply just ok the picture quality is excellent and no complaints there the sound was alright but nothing really special the features though are quite weak the blu ray has an exclusive feature about the making of the movie which was pretty cool but such a great movie and such a poor release just is not right',\n",

more sinister and underhanded than we find him here little did paula know when she married the dashing mr anton who is 16 years her senior based on the ages of the actors portraying these characters bergman was 28 when she made the film boyer was 44 that gregory had a conniving little scheme up his devious sleeve the whole time a scheme to slowly but surely drive the new mrs anton out of her mind it s a story that s been done before in the cinema to be certain but gaslight sends this plotline to a different and better plateau it plays out very nicely and effectively in this film and you got ta love ingrid in the final act when she confronts her plotting husband she s just great here in a terrific finale to the picture bergman and boyer are both just right for their parts here and i doubt if miss bergman ever looked better through the probing camera s eye than she does in her many close ups in gaslight she is simply ravishing on screen in this motion picture the supporting cast is ideal as well including the always first rate joseph cotten plus dame may whitty in a humorous role as a neighborhood busybody and angela lansbury in her very first movie role she turned 18 while the film was being made gaslight did quite well in the oscar department too earning several academy award nominations including two winning nods miss bergman won her first oscar trophy for best actress and the film also took the award for best art direction boyer and the teenaged lansbury also received nominations for best actor and best supporting actress respectively lansbury plays nancy a sassy and frisky house servant of the antons and she is delightful in the part too set in london england in the 1870s gaslight oozes victorian era atmosphere as well as the misty and foggy dampness of london the set design and costumes to my eyes are authentic looking in all respects it s filmed in black and white enhancing the movie s oft times dark and shadowy surroundings all the more the film transfer to this warner brothers dvd looks excellent very clean and clear with a pleasing dolby digital 1 0 mono soundtrack as well video is in the intended full frame ratio as it was originally seen in theaters beginning on may 4 1944 and for those fans who can not get enough gaslight wb has even included the entire 1940 u k version of the movie on side b of this dual sided dvd so this disc is literally a gaslight double feature the 40 version also a b w film stars anton walbrook and diana wynyard in the two leads i m partial to the u s adaption of the film done four years later but the 1940 variant has many die hard supporters as well a tip of the cap to warner s dvd division for seeing fit to place both versions of the movie on the very same digital disc and wb did not stop there either in addition to the second full length movie on side b of the disc some other nice extra features are presented here too there s a 13 5 minute featurette entitled reflections on gaslight hosted by ingrid bergman s daughter angela lansbury is also on hand to provide a few personal insights about her first ever experience on a movie set a nice little featurette with several behind the camera gaslight tidbits being revealed other dvd bonus items include an academy awards newsreel 1 31 in length where we get to see three oscars being awarded for 1944 excellence with awards being handed out to ingrid bergman bing crosby and 8 year old margaret o brien very good video quality on this short extra too and there s also the theatrical trailer for the 1944 edition of gaslight 1 53 more dvd data the main menus are not animated but do feature underlying theme music from the film three subtitle options available english spanish and french a secondary audio track available for the 1944 version french mono chapter stops 33 for the 1944 film 25 chapter breaks for the 1940 version snap case cardboard packaging dvd release date by warner home video february 3rd 2004 gaslight trivia notes the 1944 edition of gaslight is also known as murder in thornton square which was the title used for the film in the united kingdom the earlier 40 gaslight also had an alternate title two of them in fact angel street and a strange case of murder 1944 s gaslight works very nicely as a thriller a suspense drama a love story and a murder mystery no matter which specific category you want to slide the movie into there s one label that can be placed above all others when categorizing it the one that makes this motion picture a sheer joy to watch time and time again classic with this cast of actors how could it be anything else so turn down the gas lights in the living room and then turn on gaslight on dvd',\n",

       " 'in movies as in most other art forms the greatest of works often come in the smallest of packages such is the case with the five senses an independent canadian production that chooses for its subject nothing less profound than a meditation on what it means to be human writer director jeremy podeswa has fashioned a work of great poetic form and insight centered around a group of people who share the universal need to find true love and acceptance in a world where wounded and shattered relationships all too often result in magnified loneliness and despair like all of us each of these characters gropes towards the dual goals of intimacy with others and acceptance of oneself that are essential for human happiness some succeed while others fail just as in life but none of the characters is left unchanged by the experience the five senses though it has a plot is more of an emotional mood piece than a narrative driven drama blessed with an outstanding ensemble cast podeswa is able to draw us in to the center of his world through the use of sensory imagery and deliberate methodical pacing in fact one of the strongest themes running through the film is its examination of the part our senses play in defining our world and character podeswa understands that we have become desensitized to our senses as a result he uses this film to reconnect us to that crucial element of our beings the quiet hushed tone the muted autumnal colors the slowly moving camera the haunting musical score all combine to create an atmosphere in which the audience can become conscious of every sight and sound that comes our way in our effort to establish meaningful intimacy with other human beings we most typically rely on the sense of touch yet this can serve podeswa shows us as much to trap us into a false intimacy as to lead us into one that is genuine and lasting a number of his characters use sex as a substitute for true closeness while others make a physical connection on a much deeper level one of the most moving moments in the film occurs when a gay man most probably an aids patient breaks down in tears during a massage session his heart broken because no one has dared to touch him in so long a time this film acknowledges the vital part that tender physical contact plays in the totality of a person s humanity in a similar way the film explores the beauty of sound as one of the characters ironically an eye doctor a man dedicated to preserving the organ of one sense faces the prospect of impending deafness and yearns to create a mental catalogue of all the exquisite sounds of everyday life that he will soon no longer be able to hear and that we so routinely take for granted yet like all the other characters it is his spiritual emptiness and inability to make a meaningful connection with another human being that bring him his greatest obstacles to happiness podeswa also examines the part smell plays in making that vital human connection as one of the characters a lonely gay man revisits his former lovers to take a whiff of their scent in an effort to discover if he can smell true love yet the five senses is not merely a movie built on a clever gimmick on the contrary it breathes with the fullness of humanity because each of its many characters emerges as a fully developed instantly recognizable human being there are teenagers alienated by their own inability to fit into the accepted norm of society and made to feel guilty by their acts of careless irresponsibility there are mothers terrified of losing their children in one case literally as her young girl wanders off and disappears and in another case figuratively as her adolescent daughter seems to be slipping away into inexplicable strangeness there are adults unable to comprehend a life filled with failed relationships who strike out in desperation for that one last opportunity for happiness often with the result that they end up further away from that universally desired goal than ever one of the most daring aspects of the five senses is that it does not succumb to the temptation to provide either a happy ending or even a conclusive one for all of its characters the film acknowledges that life is a messy never ending process of changing fortunes and personal growth and it stays true to that theme all the way to the end this brave haunting and mesmerizing film definitely stands as one of the true movie finds of recent years a true work of art',\n",

       " 'almost nine years after have watched the movie for the first time and nearly 34 years since the events it inspired took place the movie apollo 13 seems even more captivating the story of apollo 13 for any who have followed the space program and especially for those who witnessed it is as gripping a story as has ever been told throughout american history it is fraught with drama intrigue plot twists and thrilling danger what s more it all really happened in april of 1970 the american public was already viewing the amazing accomplishment of landing on the moon as pass eacute and could not have cared less about the apollo 13 mission interest was so apathetic that the astronaut broadcast as the ship was about to enter lunar orbit was not even carried on television the fickle public certainly had its interest piqued when not long after the unwatched broadcast a simple house cleaning maneuver stirring the oxygen tanks exposed a deadly flaw that led to a tremendous explosion that explosion sent apollo 13 flying out of control ended any hopes of landing on the moon and left fate of the three astronauts commander jim lovell lm pilot fred haise and command module pilot jack swigert very much in doubt the heroic efforts put forth by the members of mission control as well as the astronauts themselves the bring apollo 13 safely back to earth is one of the greatest stories ever told acclaimed director ron howard saw this and inspired by lovell s own personal account of that mission crafted one of the truly great historical films to ever hit the screen apollo 13 is a true cinematic achievement it re ignites the imagination and wonder that the space program held in the 1960 s and early 1970 s using cutting edge special effects in service of the story as opposed to in place of it howard is able to give audiences a true up close view of the entire apollo mission using archive footage to craft the special effects scenes the director is able to make launch seem lifelike as if the viewer is standing atop the tower watching the rocket about to lift off the scenes in space are well crafted and extraordinarily realistic when the astronauts are forced to shutdown much of the lunar module and all of the command module to conserve power the abject cold and forlornness that these men were forced to endure is felt by the audience the true mark of this film s greatness is found in the fact that even though we know from history that the men of apollo 13 survived the final moments during re entry as played out in the movie are still incredibly gripping and tense then the emotional release that comes knowing they made it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical hard hearted viewer will get choked with emotion the storytelling and effects of apollo 13 are great but the film would likely have still fallen short if not for the tremendous cast hired to perform these roles tom hanks is solid as the unflappable jim lovell bill paxton who seems to always find a way into every blockbuster is good as the trusted but untested rookie fred haise and kevin bacon gives an accurate portrayal of last minute replacement jack swigert gary sinise plays ken mattingly the astronaut swigert replaced due to fears of a measles infection with appropriate melancholy the other truly standout performance is turned in by ed harris who plays the no nonsense rock of a flight director gene kranz harris truly deserved his oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him to have won the award over eventually supporting actor winner kevin spacey apollo 13 itself was a strong contender for best picture honors only losing out to the worthy braveheart the one baffling question is why ron howard was omitted from the best director nominations he would have to wait 7 more years before receiving his due for a beautiful mind apollo 13 is not only a great thriller it is also a telling history lesson it enables us to remember those wondrous days of the quest to reach the moon as well as the drama of that imperiled flight these days it is disheartening to realize how the space program has stagnated since those heady days apollo 13 proves beyond a doubt that we still have the men with the will knowledge and courage to take this space exploration to places beyond imagination',\n",

whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but we 65533 re all different 65533 made of different clay 65533 as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that 65533 s the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one 65533 gets 65533 committed and obsession in 65533 committed 65533 starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story admittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she 65533 s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it 65533 s forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and 597 days into the marriage he 65533 s gone off to 65533 find 65533 himself and figure it all out when joline realizes he 65533 s not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it 65533 s because of that 65533 clay 65533 she 65533 s made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his 65533 space 65533 and not even letting him know she 65533 s there she considers carl as being in a 65533 spiritual coma 65533 and it 65533 s her job to keep a 65533 spiritual vigil 65533 over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmen 65533 s 65533 grampy 65533 alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline it 65533 s a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself there 65533 s a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from joline 65533 s point of view as krueger makes us privy to joline 65533 s thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there 65533 s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it 65533 s all a part of the character she creates there 65533 s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she 65533 s a likable agreeable person and because you 65533 ve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is it 65533 s a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as joline 65533 s brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carl 65533 s editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are where we 65533 re going and what we really need 65533 committed 65533 is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking',\n",

moments the camera inches from her face glancing away for a bit of fine stage business by herodias then back tears streaming down my face to understand salome we must feel some empathy for the title character stratas salome is not a monster she is the demanding ego in each of us given what she demands and not it seems careful enough what she wished for there i took a breath varnay is nothing short of brilliant giving depth to a role that could be a walk on and riegel is a suitably disgusting herod the jokanaan i can not even remember who he is is weak the only complaint i have about the production the film uses him well but there is never a sense as there must be for the drama to work that he and salome are evenly matched this film demonstrates that opera is ripe for cgi stratas could never have sung salome on stage and probably monserrat caballe never should have will it be in my lifetime a film of salome with jon vickers singing herod welitsch salome varnay or rysanek herodias and bryn teufel as jokanaan while a delicate dark sylph mimes the title role i hope so but meantime this recording will do just fine circumstances gave me the opportunity to see the berlin mafitano estes salome on consecutive nights with this one last weekend and if you are wavering between them do not the berlin mafitano is so inferior that the difference is laughable it is first of all a videotape of a play performance not a film the stratas production confines itself to the stage set but it exploits the strengths of film brilliantly with closeups the shot of the tears streaming down stratas face toward the end of the dance and brilliantly composed shots like the one where herodias slowly replaces salome in the frame as the camera pans montage to create excitement and an arsenal of tools to make the never convincing dance appealing artistic and even vaguely erotic in this production you do not have to check the libretto to remember that jokanaan seals his fate not by insulting herodias but by repeating his hateful screed at salome from inside the cistern he did not say your name dear herod says to placate herodias that s because he is not talking about herodias any more he s moved on to younger stuff more than this the berlin mafitano suffers from what i think of as the german aesthetic disease a love of depravity for its own sake that element is welcome in wilde s original which is a nasty leering misogynistic bit of onanism best filmed by ken russell strauss and his librettist hedwig lachmann are not telling that simpleminded story the berlin aesthetic can not see past it there is a deliberate shock element in the berlin production typified by the full beaver climax to the dance which is not so much a dance as a series of freudian calisthetics and six of the seven veils are big hankies hanging from mafitano s leave nothing to the imagination dance smock but the hits keep coming the kiss is a gross carp nuzzle the production seems as set on revolting as a penthouse caligula but this is not a review of the berlin production there are now four or five dvd recording of salome if your interest is seeing an opera singer nekkid go with the maria ewing she s the weakest singer but the best dancer and convincingly youthful or track down the deidra palmour clips on youtube of a florida production and settle for a g string and the best choreography i ve ever seen for the dance if what you want is pictures to go with the music then frankly you are out of luck there is no video version to match the audio of nilsson welitsch studer neilson rysanek or marton the pictures in the met mattila production are one of those what were they thinking productions in which the action takes place in 1930 on what seems to be a cruise ship the nadja michael production is visually impressive but michael s voice is not up to the demands of the role all are videotaped productions not films and it shows teresa stratas did not have the jagdpanzer voice of a birgit nilsson the only recording i know of with georg solti and i think jon vickers that comes close to the queen of salomes ljuba welitsch still in print if you dig for it but with the invisible breaks that film permits stratas stays at top form for her harrowing 90 minutes and what is more she is a fine actress the mafitano productions there are actually two recordings with the difference that simon estes sings jokanaan in berlin terfel in covent garden are ham fisted from the abstract sets to the bug eyed madness of salome the berlin proceeds seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are performing in our laps what are we to make of salome s going on and on about simon estes ivory skin did no one notice that in extreme closeup mafitano looks her age not salome s i ve seen more productions of salome than i can count beginning i think with dame josephine barstow and including a dozen unseen recordings i can imagine a better production of salome than the stratas

       " 'in recent years sci fi have been filled with flashing lights high budget cgi effects and ridiculous stunts like in the matrix and i robot if you do not like one sci fi film you re unlikely to like any as they re all the same however my dad took down planet of the apes from our video shelf unlike most sci fi films it was made in a time that had to deal without cgi and relied completely on the break through movie make up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again the greatest film ending planet of the apes has a cast of the greatest easy storyline and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end based on pierre boulle s lesser novel la plan egrave te des singes aka monkey planet tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man s role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes the film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made in 1968 everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and planet of the apes truly taps into that fear for reasons i will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone planet of the apes tells the story of george taylor charlton heston when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet it seems to be inhospitable with no life however after traveling throughout the place which is famously referred to as the forbidden zone discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a human ape study lab where he meets zira kim hunter a sympathetic friendly and intelligent chimpanzee she almost straight away notices that taylor s intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human and she encourages him to speak however orangutan leader dr zaius sneers on zira s and her fianc eacute cornelius roddy mcdowall belief in any human intelligence and will not listen to reason despite cornelius skeptical feelings towards taylor agrees to help prove his intelligence which only proved once he finally says his famous line take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape heston is anything other then a likable character unlike ulysse merou in the novel taylor is not a polite slightly moody clever and likable character who values his friendship with zira and cornelius he represents what we as humans truly are that is self centered violent and dangerous though on stage he is reportedly according to laurence olivier truly a talented actor on screen and in planet of the apes heston basically turned up and like in many of his other films played himself nonetheless the character of taylor works as you either love him or you hate him just like every other work heston did the rebel taylor is no different from the other pushy characters heston has played over the years as a sort of physical god like body you suppose that the film where the apes are pushing us humans about cause we re basically behaving like apes is just what the doctor ordered of course we all know that it s the two lovable chimps zira and cornelius that we remember the most in the planet of the apes films for their charm and humor they bring to the story hunter s portrayal of zira was a masterpiece on it s own giving the most powerful performance of its time it s fair to say that zira is the strongest and most well developed character in the film indeed she s the only ape that taylor seems to actually like with her strong mindedness wit and admirable sense of humor it s not surprising most people who are asked who their favorite character reply zira hunter manages to make the character just how zira was meant to be more human then ape in fact she s more human then most of the beautiful female actresses in the other classic 60 s films despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make up the charm still shines through of course if you do not love the intelligent and cool zira you always have intelligent and nerdy cornelius mcdowell next to heston is one of the most credited male actors in the films as he comes over as the sort of nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug in the film taylor seems to have a love hate rivalry relationship with cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full blooded males do no matter how civilized we get a good example of this is when zira allows taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and cornelius makes his jealousy clear however taylor sticks up for him against zaius which shows not as much friendship as understanding mcdowell is the most credited actor in any planet of the apes version be it this the sequels or the tv series and is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is impossible to live up to planet of the apes is a mark in cinema history famous for these talented artists gripping story line and amazing ending that shocks you scares you breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you ll never truly experience a film like this again anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling even people who dislike sci fi are likely to enjoy this a film that truly did break star wars and challenged it like no other film ever could planet of the apes will live on in all of us it will go on forever find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us',\n",

       " 'la bamba is my favorite movie of all time hands down of all the films i have seen not many reached me the way la bamba did i first saw this movie back in the summer of 96 when i was 17 years old and i fell in love with this movie and also became a big fan of ritchie valens no joke i would watch this movie every single day it was on la bamba was a staple part of hbo s line up and even if it was on twice a day i would watch it for me each time i saw the movie it felt like the first time i would drive my friends crazy with having to watch it even after i recorded the movie they figured i would not watch it as much but i still did at the time i was actually learning the guitar and i never really played at all and this movie inspired me to actually practice and not only that but it also inspired me on wanting to be a filmmaker i really can not think of any other movie that reached me on this deep of a level like i said in the opening of my review la bamba is hands down my favorite movie of all time for starters it has some truly great music la bamba is about having a dream and not letting anyone stop you from reaching that dream it s about love and family the screenplay by luis valdez was excellent the characters are great and each of the main players all add to the movie none of the characters are just there each character plays a crucial part of the movie while yes the story does revolve around ritchie played amazingly by lou diamond phillips but in many ways movie is actually bob s story played by esai morales who pretty much steals the show there is a bond between the 2 brothers but there is also tension bob is always in ritchie s shadow despite being older and i was really able to relate more to bob in many ways than ritchie ritchie was sort of the golden boy while bob was sort of the outsider i think at some point in our lives we have felt like we were in someone s shadow either it be a friend family member or co worker the more ritchie finds success the more bob falls into this despair as all the attention goes to ritchie and he s sort of forgotten about the movie may revolve around ritchie but it s very much bob s story and esai morales gives a terrific performance la bamba is about going for your dreams and not letting anyone stop you from reaching them we all have dreams in life and most of us are too afraid to try and make them come true ritchie had a dream in life and would not let anything keep him from that and i hold that close la bamba gave me and still gives me the courage to go after my own filmmaking dreams as director luis valdez creates some truly touching scenes and some truly inspiring moments when making a bio picture normally certain parts are played up more for dramatic effect and valdez does that here but it works well a lot of the scenes with tension between bob and ritchie comes from real life and comes from the own personal experience between luis valdez and his own brother the love story between ritchie and donna played by danielle von zerneck are possibly the strongest scenes of the movie and shows a time of innocence prior to this movie i knew who ritchie valens was and i knew his music but i would not be able to place the music with the artist all the music in the movie that ritchie sings is performed by los lobos who did justice to the original music but i sought out the original versions by ritchie and loved it on my guitar i used to play donna come on let s go and la bamba non stop nothing can top the opening lick in la bamba lou diamond phillips made his screen debut but if not mistaken he actually shot stand and deliver first but this one came out first lou diamond gives a performance of a lifetime his performance is so real and inspiring i would rate this performance as one of my all time favorites by the time i saw la bamba i was already a fan of lou diamond but this movie made him one of my very favorite actors of all time esai morales though pretty much steals the show like i stated before rosanna desoto as connie ritchie s mother is excellent and joey pantoliano as ritchie s manager is excellent but joey pants always delivers elizabeth pena also gives a good performance as ritchie s ex girlfriend who is now with bob which creates some uneasy tension i ll be the first to admit the final act always gets me teary eyed the death of ritchie and buddy holly and the big bopper was so tragic buddy holly is one of my all time favorite musicians when ritchie s family and friends hear the news over the radio it s just so tragic sleepwalk played by santo johnny is so hauntingly beautiful and really adds to the scene bob walking across a wooded bridge and stops and screams ritchie s name never fails to give me the chills la bamba is truly a great and uplifting movie that is really tragic but again very uplifting ritchie was only 17 years old when he died and i remember being freaked out since i was that very age when i first saw the movie at that age death is not something we think about and it was quite creepy this may be clich eacute d but ritchie may be gone but his music and impact will never be forgotten his life inspired this movie and this movie inspired me without a doubt la bamba is my very favorite movie nothing for me comes close i can watch this movie everyday and never once get tired of it each time i see the movie it feels like the first time',\n",

       " 'the trouble with rent is that most people see it for the surface plot and take it as a musical about people with aids in fact for some of the most die hard fans it took a few listens and years of letting the lyrics sink in to understand the message behind the story it s not a musical about aids it s a musical about people learning to live life in the moment live for today and find happiness instead of dwelling in regret and indecision any artist knows this feeling and that s perhaps why so many fans are other struggling artists while people who are mainstream or professional do not find a connection with the story or its characters while the character relationships are inspired by the characters in la boheme the lyrics and the heart of this story are rooted in social issues that its creator dealt with in struggling for his art for his career and while watching many of the people around him die today we live in a society where having aids is not so much of a death sentence with the proper care and medication but in 1989 the first generations who had contracted it earlier and were now reaching the end of their lifespan were dealing with a much different life involving a lot of confusion fear and regret the point is not that all of these people have aids if you actually take the time to hear the words as a message and a lesson to learn what you receive is very profound and eye opening in fact only 4 of the 8 main characters are ill no one complained that la boheme the world s most beloved opera was about a bunch of people complaining about the plague perhaps because it s easier to listen to people dwell on something we re not afraid of anymore aids makes people uncomfortable contrary to the opinions of some viewers who feel that the costumes and sets and characters are cliche and almost caricature in nature perhaps these people do not live the life depicted in the musical after all shows like jesus christ superstar are just as ridiculous to me because of my religious beliefs or lack thereof and so one can not expect me to share the same appreciation for something i do not understand however the people who do adore the musical will tell you that they also dressed that way and lived that way and that we are not caricatures to be made fun of i did dress like that i was stared at by those who were conservative but there are two kinds of audiences those who look for entertainment value and those who appreciate the poetry and the symbolism after all with the exception of chicago i loathe flashy dancy musicals because i find them unrealistic and cheesy but that s just me to say that this is clearly an amalgamation of stereotypes by a creator who did not understand his material is utterly ridiculous if you take the time to read about jonathan larson and his life especially what inspired him to write this musical in the first place to suggest that he was some big shot who thought it might be cute to write about this subject material without firsthand experience well maybe it is the reviewers who follow the stereotypes it is mr larson who is also rolling in his grave what i will say about the rent movie is that it stinks i was a renthead who saw it every weekend during its run call me crazy in retrospect i know it sounds lame but you also have to consider that some people go to church every week to reaffirm their belief system while rent taught me to appreciate life and where i am regardless of the hardships to accept who i am and where i m going without fear to trust in risk and not feel so obligated to follow the rigid conservative structure we re pressured to comply with because of judgment and conformity in the end as long as i love what i do and surround myself in people i love happiness is with me that was a lesson worth every single one of those weekends and it s clearly not what the opposition got from this musical but it just goes to show you that there is something deeper than what s on the surface and that s a legitimate response some people do not think they should have to get to know the show first or spend more than one sitting in order to appreciate it some people expect it to be laid out for them to see a show and go home if you re expecting that this is not the kind of theatre you should see it deals with many issues from battling with your pursuit of your art versus the real world family obligations love triangles illness inability to let people into your heart all issues some of know quite well all our lives for the right person it can be a very thought provoking and life changing experience with an important message but it was a message that did not come through when hollywood tried to take control of the project fans and newbies alike either love or hate this film and i am thoroughly disappointed with it despite the nostalgia of the mostly original cast members i just happened to see a new rent movie this evening the final broadway performance filmed live on stage and i am finally satisfied that i have seen a proper rent movie that is the movie i would recommend for someone wanting to experience the musical as it should be even i found the hollywood characters flat and hollow but perhaps it s not a story for this kind of film or perhaps the cut material made more of a difference than they anticipated either way there is not rap song i do not know what that reviewer is talking about there are some weaker pieces which happens with musicals but the ones that snagged the followers are the ones with a message about acceptance love and living for the moment ultimately audiences either love or hate rent and the response is pretty predictable depending on where you came from how creative you are and the kind of social outlook you have and i do not mean social classes i mean just your social circle career path or view of city life this musical is not for everyone that s for sure but just because you did not share our experiences

       " 'if i have not said this before i ll say it again i m a huge fan of george a romero s night of the living dead and his sequels he s done for the past forty years thanks to him we truly know the horrific world of zombies and the undead with great detail and know what a frightning place it can be trapped within be it an old farmhouse a suburban mall underground bunker or anyplace that leaves you open for an attack by the flesheaters of the living of course once you create such a popular character in horror you get copycat rip off s trying to cash in on your original creation strangely though most of these types of films have had some varied degrees of success most notably the italian zombi filmakers of the 1980 s unfortunately though the one that started it all 1968 s notld due to a copyright snafu never got that precious right and soon it came clear to all that anyone could either release it own it and or make any version with that plot and title any way they choose but first a little history back in 1998 anchor bay and john a russo one of the men to help create the 68 original with romero decided to release a 30th anniversary version of the classic but instead of just re releasing the same old print like every other dvd company shot and added new footage in with the old creating a new subplot that not only hurts the original film but betrays the social commentary that was laid down in the first place a true misstep and the fans were not pleased however when it came to complete remakes at least someone got it right even before this in 1990 with romero s personal guidance and fx genius tom savini at the helm they made a night of the living dead that stayed close to the original script giving those 90 s audiences an update that not only they could be proud of but better in some aspects of gore and production values so after one well done remake one learning mistake in what not to do to a classic could it ever be re done again apparently not in 2006 with director jeff corman wanna be broadstreet in the chair they decided to give it a go again of course without any needed consent by romero but this time with a twist let s try to make it in 3d 3d really sounds like a curious idea but it truly falls flat here to be blunt notld3d is a travesty shot on a non existent budget this has to be the worse reimagining of a movie since 2001 s planet of the apes sure most of your favorite characters are here but this time mixed around and played by actors who are so stiff it s hard to tell them from the actual zombies and the story is so slow and boring that it seems like a 3am viewing of something you d expect to see on sci fi channel also while the gore factor on the 68 original was minimal at best 36 years later you still do not see much if anything at all but not for mpaa reasons but financial ones and in fact halfway through it i wondered why was this rated r in the first place it s new plot twists were lame the sets boring and the cameo by newly crowned horror icon sid haig who in my opinion is not that big of a deal in the first place is completely unnecessary that only helps in establishing that this was the ultimate in movie cash ins so it s main appeal has to be it s 3d right wrong instead of using 3d s latest technology stereoscopic that s with the shades of gray they went with the outdated anaglyphic type red blue which in turn turns the entire movie into a purplish hue mess and do not expect anything to jump out at you when it does work and it s rare it only gives backgrounds depth meaning it makes your image look deeper not closer also it should be noted outside of the behind the scenes features this whole disc is in 3d meaning that without the glasses it s unwatchable there is no 2d version on the disc included like it should have been that version is released separately so once those glasses go it s the ultimate coaster so to sum up bad movie bad 3d bad idea it was already remade well back in 1990 and eight years later was already given a gimmick that did not work either even as a movie alone a rip off flix like day of the dead 2 contagium is a better film hard to suggest even if you re a completist like myself notld3d is one dead movie that should have stayed buried redsabbath rating 3 0 10',\n",

       " 'by dane youssef rocky and good will hunting are the best of examples of what happens when out of work actors write in these situations they can write themselves work and with some talent some and a little luck these unemployable actors are never unemployed again nervous nebbish actor patrick breen wrote this experimental way off off broadway so far off i believe it did not play in halfway houses play just a kiss about how one single event can completely can change not just the lives of the kissers and their significant others but people outside their little circles a whole chain reaction one kiss between two people who should not be kissing and then hell breaks loose not just the kissers and their significant others but people outside the circle as well a promising idea even though we have seen it before one person and one desicion that s all it takes oddball character actor fisher stevens is a friend and collaborator of breen s and makes his directorial debut with this experimental film and the often dubbed character actor does some experimental character direction here with this one perhaps the film is trying to be too many things at once maybe the real problem with just a kiss is it takes too many targets social commentary on love life and relationships especially in nyc a black comedy an experiment a drama a dramedy perhaps and if that s not enough the movie tries too hard to be hip and stylish and ground breaking with it s technique jak which could probably be best described as an anti romantic comedy what bothers me the most is that it s not a succesful one but boy it sure could have been dag named after a former u n secreatry who s a real dog is a commercial director who s dating halley a woman who saved his life and living with her he s unfaithful quite frequently and seems to be prone to having flings with some of manhattan s more mentally ill chicks it s a shame dag can not be faithful to halley because she s the sanest woman he can come across maybe it could have had it been less ambitious that s not the right attitude sometimes it works sometimes it does not should we hate everybody for trying his friend peter a commercial actor who also wrote this film is having relationship trouble with his mentally unbalanced ballerina girlfriend who has a steady habit of cheating on him with everybody she also has a married man named andre taye diggs who comes over to sleep with her regularly and he winds up having sex with halley and bcomes her boyfriend peter has a quick one with colleen andre s wife and people start dropping and dying pretty quickly couples couple up with other people and the body count rises as people kill themselves or each other but now the problems with the movie a lot has been made about the film s use of rotoscoping an animation technique that was a favorite and perhaps partially invented of x rated adult animation pioneer ralph bakshi his adult cartoons often blended animation with live action this movie does the same except with a live action cast who only occassionally animate and do things that are glossed with cartoon frosting why does this movie employ rotomation perhaps because the characters are cartoon characters themselves they re so overplayed in a big broad slapstick sort of way imagine daffy duck and bugs bunny sitting around doing neil labute or todd solondz material it can be cute for a few seconds maybe it s a metephor maybe it s supposed to mean this movie is more of a metephor than commentary or maybe it s just supposed to be stylish and hip but it just does not work here pure and simple that is not to say all the rotoscoping in the movie is a bad idea the intro in the title sequence is pretty great but it just makes the rest of the badness so much more clear we hear dag telling a story where he and peter are in the back of a cab and speeding through nyc we see rotomation at work outside illuminating the already lit manhattan after hours club scene inside everything is hopping and litterally glowing so are a lot of the people a woman with a slavic accent screams at a man in a porsche and makes death threats dag moves towards her as the porsche drives away onlookers think it s a bad idea who cares she s vunerable they have passionante animal sex complete with rotomation highlighting visuals the morning after they wake up she turns out to not have an accent she s american she sobs i m engaged dag just decides they should just forget last night get her things and show her out the door oh she s crazy right before she takes that step out she smiles and says in a new accent she does this kind of s all the time and we see her eye turn a frightening color she s got multiple crazy this is a nice touch good little montage there steve but unfortunatly this is not a movie where they re satisfied with the little touches i love how diabolical the soundtrack is this music is truly inspired and kind of fitting for this movie i guess the thing how the movie is that it s so promising it plays out like a notebook of theories and ideas by a first year philsophy major the cast is great and than more able to play these characters but the movie is directed like it s farce and slapstick when it s supposed to be serious it moves at the pace and is styled like an mtv music video which is all wrong for this material one bright spark is marisa tomei ever since my cousin vinny she s been typecast into playing that one role the sexy sassy and quick tempered girlfriend who s kind of the whole point of sanity for her hair trigger on the edge boyfriend she got the oscar for the role ever since she has never been allowed to play another role but in this movie she has been granted the opportunity she plays a mentally unstable and potentially homicidal waitress she makes small talk with dag plays his confidant she reads fortunes in rings left by cold beer bottles she reads his he needs a one night stand to help him to forget she throws herself at him leave your number he does this only makes things worse in a way i can not quite reveal here there s one potentially funny seinfeld ian moment as peter makes a cellular call on a plane right before landing the radio transmission interfears with the control tower the plane breaks in half and passengers die now that really made me laugh the tourist class business and coach all die horribly whereas the first class skitter across the runway and land safely close to the gates no here is an inspired bit with a director able to juggle multiple tones a little better this could ve been a success but the actual final product plays out like an exercise or a list or experimentation of different cinematic styles which actually i guess it is steven has always been a character actor and now he s a character director let s hop his next character is at least somewhat better lets also hope their next collaboration is better hell it ll be easy to top this one in the end it just does not work just a kiss just is not enough danessf yahoo comhttp profile myspace com index cfm fuseaction user viewprofile friendid 58175682http movies yahoo com mvc mymovies',\n",

critic the works with numerous razzie wins when it became available to watch instantly on netflix i decided to see it out of curiosity s sake yesterday and as it turns out the critics were right this is one of the worst most god awful science fiction movies of all time i will address the flaws as we go along here is the premise in the year 2000 the planet earth was seized by aliens from the opposing planet psychlo they have enslaved humanity to search for gold sounds like elementary school style fan fiction does not it 1 000 years later a village tribesman jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper decides to leave the village to hunt for food and comes across another tribe who were kidnapped by the psychlos something you will notice very quickly about this movie is that 95 of the camera shots are at an angle which feels like the camera is sinking in quicksand jonnie then meets security chief terl john travolta in a role that obscures and wastes his talent and his partner in crime ker forest whitaker who plot to train the humans in secret buy their way off earth and keep the gold for themselves despite being really stupid and hardly know anything about humans they do not know what we eat how we live or our language no joke the language system can get pretty confusing at times the psychlos can sometimes appear to speak our language when at others they actually use their native speech in a human s perspective i think this is so we will not read as many subtitles if you are lazy and just want to watch the movie but they sometimes have the subtitles anyway why not just do a better job at keeping the languages separate i can make do with a little reading when they use a machine to give jonnie information about the psychlos and teach them how to use weapons and space pods they do not see this as a recipe for disaster and they could already teach them their language why did not they do that before because you can talk to them and learn so much they can get a little lazy as well how do they monitor the humans when they mine a small camera pod flies over and takes a still picture every few hours why not just use a video camera to record footage instead of plain photos jonnie comes up with a plan to take back the planet he learns everything he can about human history the idiotic aliens and their weakness within two weeks they find ft knox and give some of its gold to terl while they learn how to arm weapons build bombs and how to fly fighter jets while that is going on terl mingles with his real life wife what the nostalgia critic and i mean is that she was played by kelly preston john travolta s wife then the humans launch a surprise attack at the psychlo base so that means that six jets were able to combat an alien army but an entire military in the past were only able to put up a measly 9 minute fight the memory machine must have been a fatal disadvantage by the way just a random question but how were the humans able to find fuel for the jets if 1 000 years went by without the jets being used the gasoline would have been of no use and the jets would have been ruined i guess the military drained the gas and stored it away for when the time is right convoluted is not it in a very jumbled climax jonnie confronts and defeats terl by blowing his arm off the human blow up the base and the psychlos suffocate i forgot to mention that the psychlos can not breathe earth s atmosphere and the same can be said for the humans in psychlo s radioactive and flammable atmosphere one of them also plans to beam a bomb to the psychlo s planet the explosion would be small but due to its air design it wiped out the entire planet forever in the most idiotically simple of all world destructions so let me get this straight psychlo has an atmosphere made of radiation has never had a single explosion if the humans learned about this before then psychlo would have been destroyed to begin with how stupid could they get terl and ker survive of earth but face different fates terl is used as a hostage for other psychlo colonies to rescue while ker has a change in heart and disses terl to help the humans one of the writers j d shapiro wanted this movie to be dark and edgy with a more interesting story and a far more serious tone however franchise pictures decided to dumb down on the source material in order to appeal to children that ultimately failed the acting was so ridiculous and plagued with corny dialogue john travolta was so over the top goofy that he would be better off as jonnie instead of the bland barry pepper despite this i think forest whitaker was the only actor who was at least trying think about it ker joins the humans in the end pepper wins the worst supporting actor razzie while whitaker only got a nomination and he still had a career after this the overuse of dutch angles can get sickening and give you a neck cramp the plot was really simple minded convoluted and uninteresting and it has nothing to do with scientology logic or reason the alien race is one of the dumbest in film history the visual effects are average as well nothing special it uses cheap cgi the sets look grungy and depressing and the psychlo makeup looks so silly with long hair and claw like nails i can now see why see why it was hated by many critics i know because it was so messed up if any of the cast and crew read this review i am so sorry all this had to happen thanks a lot franchise pictures you ruined everything p s no copyright infringement is intended',\n",

       " 'the lemon drop kid never springs to mind when christmas themed movies are discussed but for a slightly different turn on the festive season and what it does to people this film deserves to be better known it certainly contains much to enjoy from the legendary bob hope as a bogus santa claus who sees the error of his ways to a beautiful and talented leading lady in marilyn maxwell an actress who also deserves to be better remembered than she is apart from its very amusing storyline involving con artists fake charities operated by fake santas and a hoard of little old ladies all wrapped up in christmas season the lemon drop kid has the distinction of marking the debut of the now classic ray evans jay livingstone carol silver bells this great song has been a yuletide favourite ever since and became forever associated with bob hope and his christmas specials for decades after based on a story by damon runyon the lemon drop kid stars bob hope as sidney melbourne but known to all as the lemon drop kid because of his fondness for that particular candy he is a small time con artist who works the race tracks skimming money off unsuspecting dopes who know nothing about horses when he unknowingly offers a rotten bet to local gangster moose moran fred clark which costs him 10 000 the kid finds himself having to repay the debt by christmas eve or as moose so delicately puts it he will find himself at the bottom of the river in a cement santa claus suit the kid goes to a freezing cold new york trying to find the money and comes up with a wild scheme to make money by setting up a charity based around local homeless identity nellie thursday jane darwell with the money for a home for old dolls the kid drags girlfriend brainy baxter marilyn maxwell into the scheme which she believes is an honourable new chapter in the kid s supposed reformation from life as a con artist not knowing he intends to skip with the collected money on chrsutmas eve to pay back moose setting up the bogus retirement home in one of moose s disused casinos the kid falls foul of local gangster oxford charley llyod nolan who takes over operation of the home and the money already collected realising christmas eve is coming the kid tries desperate measures to retrieve the money even down to dressing like a little old lady to join the home and then trying to get the money out of oxford charlie s clutches of course being christmas eve the kid has a change of heart in regards to most of what he has been doing and not only does he help get the two crime leaders put away and the money put into keeping the old folks home open but he also gets his girl brainy back and filled with the proper christmas spirit he agrees finally to marry her bringing the story to a happy conclusion somehow even when he is playing a con man bob hope had a way of still being likeable i believe he has never been better than in this very funny role which played another way may have come across as an extremely unlikeable character playing a weak willed schemer on the run from gangsters and fearing for his life was a role tailor made for hope the quips come fast and furious from his hilarious remark to the losing horse to take a couple of extra carrots out of petty cash through to his very funny remarks when dressed in drag describing his knitting to the other old ladies in the retirement home being a bob hope film of course there is the expected reference to bing crosby which always guarentees a laugh as film fantasy and reality cross each other bob hope s chemistry with marilyn maxwell works wonderfully here and the two make a great duo when either exchanging comic barbs or especially when singing the immortal silver bells for the first time on screen the set of lovable local rogues that the kid recruits to collect money for the bogus charity also raises some great laughs with their crooked looking faces under santa s white beard and is headed by comic legend william frawley who of course won everlasting fame as fred mertz on i love lucy academy award winning actress jane darwell also does very well in her part of nellie thursday who becomes the centre of the kids wild money making scheme she displays just the right elements of street smartness with touches of vulnerability to deliver a terrific performance and some of her work with bob hope in particular at the sentimental conclusion really helps fill the screen with christmas spirit seldom seen during the holiday period nowadays the lemon drop kid deserves to be better remembered and certainly contains some of bob hope s more enjoyable later film comedy work i have included it now for a number of years in my christmas viewing and its slightly cynical view of alot of human nature which neverthless is reformed before the fadeout offers a different turn than most contemporary holiday movies bob hope and christmas even nowadays still go hand in hand in by belief and his rendition of the classic silver bells is sure to melt your heart as it still does mine even after repeated screenings a great viewing experience is guarenteed when hope plays the ever unsuccessful con man out to fleece the goodwill to all men belief held sacred at christmas but who thankfully sees the error of his ways just in time for christmas highly recommended festive viewing which you need to catch some time this season',\n",

       " 'it is rather difficult to review this movies as one has to take in all the reasons why this movie was bound to fail miserably first of all this is the sequel somewhat to the interview with the vampire movie although the third book in the series since the second book of the series the vampire lestat had not been made into a movie the producers of this film had to compact two books of history into one movie that is one reason why the film left out the majority of both books read the books by the way second of all this film was sequel to the extremely popular and sucessful inteview with the vampire so naturally repeating that formula would have been very impossible indeed one reason for that is that the previous film was cast with some very big stars tom cruise brad pitt antonio banderas christian slater while queen of the damned was cast with only one aalyiah the rest of the cast was relatively unknown stuart townsend is not really well known as of now all these problems aside the movie itself is quite horrible if you have read the book you will be very disappointed mainly because much of rice s rich characterization is lost none of the vampire s history is revealed most specifically the legend of the twins which is left totally out the rest of the vampires are only glimpsed near the end of the movie and are never referred to by name unless you ve read the book you will not be able to tell who s who other idiotic point is that the older vampires for all their short time on screen dress in the clothing of the era they were made which is entirely untrue in the book something that other s might consider minor is the disappointing lack of physical resemblance the characters have to their counterparts in the books for example marius is described as a man in his forties with long gray hair and a beautiful face jesse is much older in the book with very prominent red hair and the brief appearance of armand is vastly wrong because he looks more like lestat would the only correct thing about armand s physical appearance is his age he is much younger here than in interview with the vampire because the books state armand was made a vampire when he was 17 the only one who really looked close to his description is lestat stuart townsend looked very much like my conception of lestat though his voice was far too deep still he did not look as good as tom cruise in that part physical resemblance is important because vampires are described as being very sensual and beautiful and the movies suffers for failing to accurately bring those literary characters to movie life i will not really start with the inaccuracies with the book there were far too many the main liberties taken besides the absence of the other vampires were the relationship with marius and lestat lestat was not made by marius as others have pointed out and marius as portrayed as something of an evil vampire when in the book he is lestat s mentor and he only slays evil men the ending is wholly different and impossible to compare and contrast here read the books the main reason i think it failed is that the movie sacrificed a rich story for pop culture refrences more is made of this movie s soundtrack and lestat s brief career as a nu metal star than anything else even the story for the reasons i described in the beginning of this review i do think the filmakers were doomed to repeat the success of interview with the vampire but that is no excuse for not even making an effort the producers try to make excuses if for most notably with the cut scenes where they try to explain why they cut more footage of the other vampires in conclusion queen of the damned is a miserable failure mainly for giving up a rich and thrilling story for pop culture references as i have said it would have been impossible to repeat the success of the former vampire movie but this movie is just too awful to even stand on it s own',\n",

       " 'i rarely write reviews i just tend to read them and most are quite helpful i m writing this for two reasons to comment on some of the negative reviews here and to share my thoughts and feelings about gran torino which may be clint eastwood s last movie last night it was late and i still was not tired at all so i went to my dvd collection and gran torino practically jumped into my hands i put it in and before i started to watch it for the 6th time in the last 3 weeks something told me to read the reviews at amazon after perusing through all 252 comments i was amazed at the people who gave negative reviews the most used comment was wooden acting my brother who studied cinema and is a screenwriter and i and i studied film as well talked about that very same comment that so called professional critics leveled at the movie we laughed at that because of two reasons we grew up near a lot of asian people and if they do not know you they are very withdrawn and may seem a bit well wooden so clint was being true to life with the portrayal of the hmong people the other thing that made us laugh is that clint eastwood is meticulous and thorough when he does pre prep for any movie especially one he plans to direct and act in his work ethic allows him to be spontaneous behind and in front of the camera and the critics did not even notice that he purposely shot this film with a grainy stock almost to make it have the look of a student film or a documentary he intended to give the look and feel of gran torino the same sense of immediacy and uncertainty walt kowalski feels why else start with a funeral followed by the experience we the audience have of seeing him alone in a house filled with so called family we re intended to feel his unease and sense of aloneness as well and at the same time next door a child is being blessed death and aloneness at his house while new birth and renewal of life is just next door although he does not know it at the time while we do one last note about the negative commentors i noticed that they tended to be very short like one sentence or two whereas the people who liked loved the movie wrote some really detailed comments on what the movie meant to them not one negative comment gave a detailed account of why they did not like the movie it seems they just got on the wooden acting bandwagon perhaps they may be relying on he crituque of so called critics they d either read or seen on tv i ve been watching a lot of clint eastwood and robert redford movies lately i ve just been really drawn to them i feel that they had similar careers in that that they were perceived at first as nothing more than pretty boys eye candy for the box office but they both were very serious about their craft and became very masterful along the way both learned the basics and became excellent actors directors and story tellers and both have created some of the best american cinema since the 1970s what i love about both for some reason they seem very much the same in that they let expression and subtleties express so much more than words ever could is that they are major stars and icons in our culture but they were mostly focused on their craft so we have the benefit of a very rich legacy of cinema to learn from and their movies are so fun to watch the lessons are effortlessly learned now that s magic to me as a musician writer and hopefully one day a screenwriter as well i can not even think of a better place to start than with movies from clint eastwood and robert redford less is more is a sometimes over used and misunderstood adage with them they make that saying sing like maria callas at her peak they ve taught me that economy can equal depth as well as a very important thing get the audience engaged and thinking they ve showed me in movie after brilliant movie just how much you can get from that simple yet difficult to master concept gran torino is clint eastwood s summation of his career his limning the interstices of his place as an icon in cinema and yet another treatise on the art of less is more i first saw it in the theatre the first time in years i d even had the desire to go see a movie i was a bit shocked at the graininess of the film stock at first but then i understood what he was doing just like in unforgiven he used shadow to express light here he was using graininess to express the very refined craft of making a film and as i wrote earlier that grain gives a sense of immediacy almost as if he could not wait to say action and roll film he sends up dirty harry get off my lawn and the outlaw josey wales the first time he has that what turns out to be a spitting contest of sorts with the hmong grandmother who s spit is more potent than his was hilarious those two characters redefined modern cinema with dirty harry an entire genre of movies would not have been as rich as they became the outlaw josey wales brought the western back to prominence in modern cinema while embodying these mythic characters on film he always knew his role in becoming an icon and understood the larger implications so while sending them up he also adds a great degree of pathos to harry callahan and josey wales he s studying them along with us and adding more depth and richness to them what a brilliant technique with gran torino we are watching a master seemingly effortlessly and quite playfully display his work for us to see just what it takes to make great art and he gives a very eloquent summation of his iconic impact on modern cinema and besides that it s a great film popcorn please this movie clearly shows he was not just a pretty boy there was a great artist always inside',\n",

       " 'three and a half stars for this one okay singh is kinng is pretty silly but tubloads of fun it s mostly a comedy but with several action sequences thrown in and naturally a romantic subplot creeps in in the punjab region there sits a tiny village in which dwells the well meaning but ridiculously accident prone happy singh akshay kumar when happy s most recent escapade in which he tries to capture a runaway chicken ends up wrecking half the village the outraged villagers concoct a scheme to get him out of their hair the scheme pays off as it results in happy volunteering to go to australia to fetch back the notorious gangster lucky singh who hails from this same village and is causing it massive levels of shame with his illegal exploits so off happy goes except that a ticket mishap has him making a brief stopover in egypt where he meets and falls for the gorgeous law student sonia katrina kaif finally in australia happy finds himself getting the brush off from lucky who d rather stay in australia and keep on living it up as a powerful gangster but when lucky is paralyzed in a hilarious sequence happy is sort of elected as the new don the new king of the australian underworld so now singh is kinng yes the plot is absurd and over the top the characters are full on stereotypes and if you have not seen a lot of bollywood films this one might make you groan quite vigorously one constant in bollywood is the big coincidence and that s here too i do not think it s much of a shocker when you find out that the girl happy meets and falls for in egypt turns out to be the daughter of the kindly old woman who befriends him in australia and following that age old bollywood story device of course the daughter is already engaged speaking of that old woman the plot takes time to borrow a page from frank capra s lady for a day seems that once upon a time the old woman was very rich but since then has fallen on tough times her daughter sonia is returning from her time abroad expecting to still be rich happy singh as the new and wealthy crime lord decides to have himself and his gang pose as the old woman s household servants he also lets her pass off his opulent mansion as her own now can happy not only pull off this masquerade but also rehabilitate his incorrigible henchmen and can he get the girl by the way these questions are purely rhetorical since the answers are pretty much no brainers this movie ended up ruling the box offices in india and it s largely because of akshay kumar who is right up there now amongst bollywood s current royalty akshay has by now proven that he can cover both dramatic and comedic roles he s amusing here as happy but then convincingly cool and heroic when the story calls for it happy singh is reminiscent of akshay s backwoods character in namastey london dvd and a bit like in namastey london there are moments here in which akshay indulges in wistful glances at katrina singh is kinng is akshay s fourth film with katrina kaif and by now this teaming is a proven recipe for box office success namastey london is what put katrina on the bollywood map and also the film which shows off her best acting performance here her acting is okay and as usual she looks stunning but i wish there were more depth to her film character singh is kinng offers up harmless exuberant entertainment zany shenanigans and lavish musical numbers and lots of bright sunny colors the end credits showcase the singh is kinng track with this one featuring snoop dogg it s worth it just to see akshay and snoop side by side by the way just about every song in the soundtrack is good and catchy but my favorite has to be the very smooth bas ek kinng there are parts which will make you smile i liked everything involving saint divine finger the nickname of the ex mob boss lucky after he became paralyzed those familiar with bollywood will get a kick out of one particular sequence in which crooks masked as famous bollywood actors kidnap one particularly annoying character of course as mentioned there are parts which will probably make you groan me i did not care too much for the hen chasing scene or any of the scenes with the brother who s nearly blind and deaf in one ear like i said much of this is silly but akshay makes it fun and i enjoy ogling katrina kaif what i have is the fancy kinng s edition 2 disc dvd package it comes with six singh is kinng postcards a singh is kinng decal and some kind of green bauble disc 1 has the feature film disc 2 has the following the making of the movie segment with cast interviews partly in english making of the music but with barely a mention of snoop the title track featuring snoop dogg the tight bas ek kinng remix the full teri ore song kinng in toronto a live promo segment in toronto with appearances by akshay and rdb the great british bhangra group who wrote and helped perform singh is kinng and the theatrical trailer not half bad for bonus stuff but

       " 'maybe his next film can be the story of how i pissed off movie goer forced to suffer thorough a truly bad director s inane and amateurish films comes to collect the debt by beating it out of said director s a s the epiphany comes when i learn the lesson that it is i who is really at fault because i keep watching this the message free will can be a bit h uwe boll has often been called an ed wood for a new generation this would be fine if he would admit what a cruddy director he is and just go the straight cheese route but he insists on trying to make good movies so we can not even laugh and the schlock of it all instead we marvel at how poorly he tries to cover up his dreck with good looking production values locals and actors in house of the dead he was smart enough to get a bunch of hot girls naked for no other reason than to distract the movie s key demographic video game geek teens from the fact that everything else about the movie sucked exotic locals and an attractive albeit untalented cast not withstanding the action was directed so poorly blandly and confusingly that the whole thing was rendered incomprehensible the movie was one long yawn of stuff seen a million times before only this time done more ineptly than perhaps ever before it was one of the worst films i had ever seen of course i had not seen alone in the dark yet everything that went wrong with house of the dead goes wrong in that pos as well except this time it was somehow worse because there is a more convoluted plot that wastes even more of the viewer s time as if the writers are under the impression it is a good story and we care the action bad as was in house is even lacking here and to add insult to injury this one did not even have the decency to throw in any gratuitous shots and now uwe gives us bloodrayne and with it he has crafted sort of a film trilogy from hell if anyone has ever indeed sold his soul to the devil the way we have seen in countless stories it must be mr boll how this man keeps getting these films into theatres rather than straight to video not to mention work at all is beyond me he also somehow attracts talented actors that would be impressive names in any schlocky horror movie not to mention one from this guy jurgen prochnow in house of the dead and in this film we have the terminatress kristana loken as well as michael madsen reservoir dogs michelle rodriguez s w a t tvs lost billy zane titanic and most baffling ben kingsly ben kingsley can you imagine his agent saying yeah it s from the acclaimed director of alone in the dark do it granted a lot of these names tend to toil in low budget fare from time to time but they are names just the same why they look at these movies and this director and jump on board is beyond me his movies are not hits they all flop none has made more than 5 million and are all panned by critics and those who see them so again why does he get to keep making movies and why do known actors want to make them with him this is an even better question to pose to studio execs why do his movies keep going into theatres why does he get work at all the devil s got some explaining to do bloodrayne is what you d get if lord of the rings and from dusk till dawn had a retarded baby it may actually earn the faint praise as the best of boll s films that s a bit like calling puke better than but if you have to rank all these abominations i think this one wins it starts out with a nice moody tone and some picturesque cinematography but then people start to speak the dialogue and performances are atrocious from the get go even by the generally good actors michael madsen sets the tone right off he utters the film s first line as if he s reading it from his hooked on phonics book and all the other actors follow suit loken is hot doing something akin to a poor wo man s charlize therone and this is a vampire movie that remembers to supply the blood and but the action again is awful fight scenes are sped up and slowed down and blurred and every other damn trick to cover up their lameness some of the death scenes are fun in an over the top comically gory way but most of the deformed faces of vampires are laughably obvious masks and other things that have their heads severed or blood drained are obvious dummies ben kingsley whether it is intentional or not is stuck in pancake make up and looks laughably awful and meatloaf turns up doing his usual over the top performance shtick he s the only who seems to realize this thing sucks so hammy is the way to go at least he sucks on purpose whereas everyone else just sucks i can not stress enough that it is the dialog and the awful line readings that really make this unbearable to observe i mean did they bother to reshoot anything before releasing this second to that are the poorly staged action scenes and third is the over all sense of blandness that hangs over this thing the story just does not matter and is so bad and every time it comes into play you just wan na grab for the fast forward button so this sounds pretty bad right funny bad even i do not know maybe if you re drunk but i still say this movie does not even warrant a recommendation on the so bad its entertaining scale there are those moments to be sure but because it takes itself so seriously as a whole the plot pops up and there are long moments of pure dead screen time stuff is happening but you could care less and those stretches ai n t funny which brings me back to my recommendation that if boll is gon na keep making these crapfests he needs to get out of his own way and stop thinking somewhere along the line one of them is gon na be good embrace is inner ed wood ness camp it up ham it up and just give us the over the top junk that is the only reason most people watch movies with titles like house of the dead alone in the dark and bloodrayne to begin with he can start with the story i mentioned at the top of this review or something autobiographical perhaps the story of his meeting with beelzebub of course we all know what happens there but we do not yet know how it ends ah chances are he d even screw up that

       " 'i wanted so badly to enjoy this film i kept hoping that somehow it would pick up and get on its feet unfortunately it never did and in fact just kind of gave way to a bizarre nothingness somewhere in the middle basically this is about a cynical paranormal writer staying in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happened over the years and really that s about it yet there was so much to work with in the story it could have been deeper the plot more involved the characters could have been so much more than they were this film is a hodge podge of mostly nebulous loose ends that never get tied up it moves at a snails pace and you wait for something that just never happens the ending is unbelievable and contrived however the special effects are very good',\n",

       " 'release date june 28 2006director bryan singerruntime 2 hours 34 minuteslocations new south wales australia and new york citycast brandon routh superman kate bosworth lois kevin spacey luthor james marsden richard white parker posey kitty frank langella perry white eve marie saint clark s mom and marlon brando jor el story superman returns to earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld as clark kent he gets his job back at the daily planet newspaper but finds out lois lane has moved on without him having a live in fiance marsden and a five year old child not to mention winning a pulitzer for her article why the world does n t need superman meanwhile lex luthor and his henchmen discover superman s fortress of solitude and steal some of the alien crystals luthor s mad scheme is to create a new continent killing billions of people in the process before seeing this film i scanned many of the amazon reviews to see if it was worthwhile and the first thing i noticed was that most of the people wrote very long detailed reviews i thought wow these superman fans really take ol supes seriously i also noticed that people either seemed to love the film or hate it count me as one who loved it i m not the biggest superman fan but i used to collect many of the comics and i loved the first two movies i only had a half hour to kill last saturday night but the movie was so good i watched well over an hour without really realizing it and finished it the next night in other words the film successfully pulled me into the story and i lost track of time this is a good sign especially when the film has so many dramatic parts the story is an obvious retelling of the christ story jor el gives his son to protect save humankind superman repeatedly states that he s everywhere and will always be around i e omnipresent luthor and his henchmen s beating of supes is reminiscent of christ s beating before his crucifixion superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from luthor s new continent when superman dies above the atmosphere of earth he is shown in a cross posture in adition to this lois lane is an obvious type of atheism although she once believed in and even loved superman she s now convinced the world does not really need him she s obviously unhappy and bitter she lacks the pizzazz she had when she once believed of course all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer s attention this is especially vital when the picture is two and a half hours long but it succeeds the film definitely has an epic vibe to it even more so than the first in the series it seems more serious i e less campy especially where luthor and his team are concerned the film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality even though the whole superman mythos is totally absurd the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real on top of all this there are numerous humorous parts which are truly laugh out loud funny watch out for the hilarious it s a bird it s a plane piece other things worth commenting on some complain that kate bosworth lacks charisma as lois lane but this all fits into the bitter i no longer believe subplot bosworth is fine in the role some complain about superman s 5 year visit to krypton what s the problem part of my youth was spent in minneapolis and i ve gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity why would not superman feel the same way why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of kryptonite radioactive pieces of his homeworld which would severely weaken him not to mention he gets his powers from the earth s sun some complain about lois fiance and her son who may or may not be the offspring of supes would n t it be natural for lois to move on after about two years waiting her shacking up before marriage can be attributed to her new i no longer believe mentality love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the christ story superman loves lois and vice versa even though lois is initially in denial love gives life and saves from death i liked the fact that lois fiance marsden is not made out to be a villain interestingly lois picked a man who as a pilot could fly her around like supes albeit less spectacularly i also like the fact that the film shows lois being faithful to marsden even though she discovers she still loves superman the human heart is capable of loving more than one person but can only be faithful or committed to one if you know what i mean frank langella is his usual charismatic self as perry white kevin spacey is excellent as luthor much better than hackman this is especially evident as the story progresses his larger than life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for supe s main foe there are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story there s obviously no rush to get to the next cgi action scene those with add beware needless to say this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects superman returns was one of the most expensive films ever made at 209 million but made most of it back in north america 200 million while almost doubling it worldwide 391 million what s strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers claiming it should have made 500 million bottom line i was truly surprised to discover how good superman returns is this is an epic and moving superhero film sci fi fantasy at it s best in fact is it as good or better than the best superhero films not only is it as good or better it s deeper',\n",

       " 'i was very disappointed with how far this movie strays from the actual story it is roughly prince caspian but is lacking a lot of major elements number one they left out aslan almost entirely until the very end those who are familiar with the book will remember that aslan is the most important part of the story s strength and development it was he who called the children into narnia for his purpose an plan half of the book is about aslan and the children so the fact that they left his importance out of the movie really ruins the story no aslan no narnia there are a number of other aspects that do not stick to the book but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not strayed from the real heart of the story the other big disappointment for me was how they altered peter s character his whole attitude changed you never get a chance to warm up to him and in the end are almost glad that he will not be returning to narnia the same can be said for susan the story line seemed very weak and the relationship that they tried to create between caspian and susan was totally unnecessary and i felt helped a great deal in ruining the film as well but if you are not interested in the faithfulness of the story andrew adamson s prince caspian is an action packed adventure with many wonderful visual and special effects however i would highly recommend that you read the story the book has so much more richness and purpose i wish they had stuck to this story as well as they had the the lion the witch and the wardrobe i hope that they will do better on the voyage of the dawn treader we will see these are just a few of my thoughts needless to say i feel that they could have made this film a lot better',\n",

ed wood for a new generation this would be fine if he would admit what a cruddy director he is and just go the straight cheese route but he insists on trying to make good movies so we can not even laugh and the schlock of it all instead we marvel at how poorly he tries to cover up his dreck with good looking production values locals and actors in house of the dead he was smart enough to get a bunch of hot girls naked for no other reason than to distract the movie s key demographic video game geek teens from the fact that everything else about the movie sucked exotic locals and an attractive albeit untalented cast not withstanding the action was directed so poorly blandly and confusingly that the whole thing was rendered incomprehensible the movie was one long yawn of stuff seen a million times before only this time done more ineptly than perhaps ever before it was one of the worst films i had ever seen of course i had not seen alone in the dark yet everything that went wrong with house of the dead goes wrong in that pos as well except this time it was somehow worse because there is a more convoluted plot that wastes even more of the viewer s time as if the writers are under the impression it is a good story and we care the action bad as was in house is even lacking here and to add insult to injury this one did not even have the decency to throw in any gratuitous shots and now uwe gives us bloodrayne and with it he has crafted sort of a film trilogy from hell if anyone has ever indeed sold his soul to the devil the way we have seen in countless stories it must be mr boll how this man keeps getting these films into theatres rather than straight to video not to mention work at all is beyond me he also somehow attracts talented actors that would be impressive names in any schlocky horror movie not to mention one from this guy jurgen prochnow in house of the dead and in this film we have the terminatress kristana loken as well as michael madsen reservoir dogs michelle rodriguez s w a t tvs lost billy zane titanic and most baffling ben kingsly ben kingsley can you imagine his agent saying yeah it s from the acclaimed director of alone in the dark do it granted a lot of these names tend to toil in low budget fare from time to time but they are names just the same why they look at these movies and this director and jump on board is beyond me his movies are not hits they all flop none has made more than 5 million and are all panned by critics and those who see them so again why does he get to keep making movies and why do known actors want to make them with him this is an even better question to pose to studio execs why do his movies keep going into theatres why does he get work at all the devil s got some explaining to do bloodrayne is what you d get if lord of the rings and from dusk till dawn had a retarded baby it may actually earn the faint praise as the best of boll s films that s a bit like calling puke better than but if you have to rank all these abominations i think this one wins it starts out with a nice moody tone and some picturesque cinematography but then people start to speak the dialogue and performances are atrocious from the get go even by the generally good actors michael madsen sets the tone right off he utters the film s first line as if he s reading it from his hooked on phonics book and all the other actors follow suit loken is hot doing something akin to a poor wo man s charlize therone and this is a vampire movie that remembers to supply the blood and but the action again is awful fight scenes are sped up and slowed down and blurred and every other damn trick to cover up their lameness some of the death scenes are fun in an over the top comically gory way but most of the deformed faces of vampires are laughably obvious masks and other things that have their heads severed or blood drained are obvious dummies ben kingsley whether it is intentional or not is stuck in pancake make up and looks laughably awful and meatloaf turns up doing his usual over the top performance shtick he s the only who seems to realize this thing sucks so hammy is the way to go at least he sucks on purpose whereas everyone else just sucks i can not stress enough that it is the dialog and the awful line readings that really make this unbearable to observe i mean did they bother to reshoot anything before releasing this second to that are the poorly staged action scenes and third is the over all sense of blandness that hangs over this thing the story just does not matter and is so bad and every time it comes into play you just wan na grab for the fast forward button so this sounds pretty bad right funny bad even i do not know maybe if you re drunk but i still say this movie does not even warrant a recommendation on the so bad its entertaining scale there are those moments to be sure but because it takes itself so seriously as a whole the plot pops up and there are long moments of pure dead screen time stuff is happening but you could care less and those stretches ai n t funny which brings me back to my recommendation that if boll is gon na keep making these crapfests he needs to get out of his own way and stop thinking somewhere along the line one of them is gon na be good embrace is inner ed wood ness camp it up ham it up and just give us the over the top junk that is the only reason most people watch movies with titles like house of the dead alone in the dark and bloodrayne to begin with he can start with the story i mentioned at the top of this review or something autobiographical perhaps the story of his meeting with beelzebub of course we all know what happens there but we do not yet know how it ends ah chances are he d even screw up that

       " 'lost highway is not as linear and thus satisfying to our narrative desire as mulholland drive because it indeed seems to try too hard to be weird but david lynch is one of the only directors who understands how strangely dreamlike cinema itself can be like hitchcock he exploits this situation for all its worth but in the manner of the classic surrealists and i think this movie can be best experienced in the setting of an actual theater this film s terrain is even more deeply subconscious than mulholland drive because its ultimate subject seems to be the act of watching a narrative movie itself as channeled through a paragon of truth in our society crime scene photos this is what makes it interesting it s so open ended though that it allows every viewer their own personal interpretation because the surface plot is mixed up with its own interpretative clues my take is that fred madison believes he was convicted of murdering his wife based on the images contained in the last videotape which is delivered to he and renee patricia arquette during the first act the most crucial line is his declaration that he does not like cameras because he prefers to remember things his own way not necessarily the way they happened this entire first section of the film is the way fred remembers his life before being incarcerated and takes place in the space of a second after he is punched in the face by the arresting police officer believing in the mysterious tapes which preceded the murder is his way of trying to convince himself that he did not do it that the mystery man robert blake as wifekiller ironic eh actually did the second part less effective due to its lighter tone is madison s way of escaping the reality of the electric chair the light above his cell flickers and buzzes as presumably someone is being executed which triggers his fantasy of escaping by physically becoming another person yet even in the life of this younger man renee returns as a double and he is free to begin a life with her without the memory of his marriage but learns the sordid truth about her life the mystery man again shows up this time helping him commit conscious murder of her former pimp and allowing it to be videotaped to convince himself that this murder which fred may have committed before the movie begins was right but who the hell knows the plot i mapped this film out after i saw it the first time and there are too many doubles of whose nature we as viewers can not trust as either physical reality or mental projection each interpretation points at the other like the moebius strip lynch claims the film embodies it s more like a puzzle structured around themes mostly a subtext involving photography the photo of the twins the porn movies the creepy videotapes which show up on their doorstep like evil calling cards be sure to get a letterboxed version of this film lynch s visual compositions are based upon horizontal angles all throughout and there are many extreme close ups in which the tops of heads are truncated for some malevolent intent i m sure the cinematography is great and the sound track not the music but the atmospherics which lynch always meticulously makes himself is as important as the images just as in eraserhead and after watching a particular scene in this film you ll be very careful around glass tables with sharp edges for the rest of your life',\n",

       " 'in this review i ll be reviewing both dvd versions of the excellent film the exorcist that are available on dvd there is another exorcist dvd that came out in 1997 but is now discontinued this will not be reviewed first i will review the dvds then i will analyze both versions of the film to see which is the better version to own dvds picture both versions are presented in their original theatrical aspect ratio of about 1 78 1 in terms of video quality both dvds are about equal sharpness and detail are pretty good for a film that s now 30 years old this is certainly the best the exorcist has ever looked if you have viewed only the vhs or the laserdisc then this can look like a pretty washed out film not so on dvd colors are very good for a 30 year old film 5 5 sound while the video quality on both dvds were very close here the version you ve never seen definately has the edge the dolby digital 5 1 remix on the 25th anniversary dvd is pretty good surrounds are not that active and most of the action seems to take place in the center channel there is one scene in the film that screamed for surround sound but the surrounds are not active in this scene on this dvd that scene is during the exorcism the room begins to shake violently as regan is floating in the air the dolby digital 5 1 ex remix on the version you ve never seen corrects not only this scene but the surrounds are much more active for a much more enthralling and ultimately more frightening mix the mix on the version you ve never seen is absolutely astonishing for a 30 year old film 25th anniv 4 5 version you ve 5 5 extras the 25th anniversary dvd is filled with fascinating extras first off is a commentary by director willaim friedkin this is very entertaining and informative there s also a commentary by william peter blatty which is not as good but still worthwhile next up is the excellent 75 minute documentary the fear of god the making of the exorcist this is really a great documentary and is one of the best i ve ever seen then there are additional interviews with friedkin and blatty discussing friedkin s cut of the film and how blatty prefers the cut that was orinally shown to him next up are sketches and storyboards finally there are about 7 or 8 tv spots and 4 theatrical trailors the version you ve never seen does not have near as many extras first up there s a new commentary by friedkin which just basically explain what s going on onscreen and some the spiritual meanings behind the movie there s also some production notes 2 theatrical trailors 4 tv spots and 2 radio commercials 25th anniv 5 5 version you ve 3 5 movie the exorcist is an excellent film anyone who says that this film is pure evil and should never be seen by anyone and satan worshipers would only enjoy this movie do not have any idea what they re talking about i m a christian and i think that this is a very important film that has a deep and powerful message does the devil win at the end absolutely not notice if you will when father karras screams at the demon to come into him in an act of self sacrifice his face flashes briefly then he jumps out the window to save regan and as father dyer is giving him the last rights damion squeezes dyers hand showing that he is conscience enough to give his soul to god so good won over absolute evil is there evil in the film yes what i admire most about the exorcist is that friedkin had the guts to show pure evil and he did not pussy foot around the subject matter i also feel that the masturbation with the crucifix scene was merited and did serve an ultimate purpose is the movie offensive yes but it had to be one must remember that if somebody were possessed by a demon that this is probably what it would be like the demon would scream every foul word possible in an attempt to weaken those around it i believe what william friedking says about the film you take out of the film what you bring to it if you believe like i do that there is good in the world and that it can overcome evil then the exorcist will re affirm your faith i believe that this is an excellent thought provoking film and should be seen by every one especially catholics and christians who have open minds the version you ve never seen adds 11 minuted of footage back into the original film i did not mind the new ending i felt that the spider walk sequence felt really odd and out of place the extended dialog between karras and merrin is well done and probably should have been there in the first place also there is a new examination scene at the doctors office with regan this too should have been left in the film another important scene that should have been in the original cut is a scene with father karras listening to a tape of regan s natural voice before the possession there is another cut scene that can bee seen on the 25th anniversary dvd of regan and her mother chris macneil touring around washington for regan s birthday that i really wish would have been put back in whichever way you choose to watch the film it s still a masterpice and the scariest film of all time both versions 5 5',\n",

       " 'all 3 films are pretty sitting on the edge of your seat exciting but most folk already know the story lines the first of the 3 films the bourne identity has both excellent video and very discreet channel tracking in the audio the sound mixers did an excellent job of using all the surround channels and did not allow the soundtrack to hide the various foley effects in any of the front or rear channels of course in all the excitement your subwoofer will get a fine workout the video transfer is quite good with no video noise aliasing or artifacts this movie started the whole franchise and it was a super start my only question was how bourne getting shot in the back brought out his amnesia in the first place that was never really answered as amnesia would generally come about from a serious head trauma and not from 2 bullets in the back the bourne supremacy the second film of the trilogy made far greater use of the hand held camera and while it did not bother me i recall a friend and professional photographer mentioning that it got him seasick the video transfer on blu ray was excellent in all respects but i also noticed a great deal less of directional audio use rather than put money into more discreet sound editing the producers boosted up the sound track which pretty much enveloped the entire sound stage front and rear it s not that the soundtrack did not fit the film it certainly does and creates the ambience of excitement the bourne film requires but a greater focus on the 5 1 sound stage for foley effects would have been nice the last of the trilogy the bourne ultimatum completes the package with equal strength in the video transfer i saw no weaknesses in any of the video transfers for the 3 films but once again in the bourne ultimatum you would think that with all the excitement going on that usage of the front sides and rear surrounds would be more prominent i was disappointed that like the bourne supremacy they simply upped the audio levels of the soundtrack which would overshadow any foley effects i m not saying there is no use of the discreets in either of the last two films but no where as much as what could have been or as was used in the first bourne identity to save they just boost the soundtrack level and that is a shame during the fight scene there are things being thrown glass breaking and all sorts of mayhem that easily could have been steered to the left or right front or back thus on that score i was disappointed never the less this is a great collection to have and the excitement and pacing of the 3 films is just excellent there are plenty of deleted scenes and other making of shorts as well as commentary with no wasted space for previews and ads for other movies well worth the cost hopefully this review has been of help and if so please check the helpful button so i know i am on the correct path with my reviews for you thanks',\n",

       " 'now i have not seen every film academy award winner michael caine s been in but i ve seen enough to know this feature simply titled get carter 1971 is definitely one of his more unappreciated features based on ted lewis novel titled jack s return home and adapted for the screen and directed by mike hodges the terminal man flash gordon croupier the film stars as i ve mentioned michael caine zulu too late the hero sleuth hannah and her sisters who was originally born maurice joseph micklewhite how s that for a useless bit of trivia also appearing is ian hendry captain kronos vampire hunter britt ekland the wicker man john osborne tomorrow never comes geraldine moffat the last chapter alun armstrong krull and bryan mosley far from the madding crowd caine plays jack carter an enforcer type for a london mob who returns to his hometown of newcastle a bleak dreary industrial town on the northern coast to attend the funeral of his brother who died in a rather mysterious car accident carter suspicious of the incident sets himself up at a local boarding house and prodding into the seedy underbelly of the local underworld soon discovering there s more to his brother s death than what s put forth in the official recounting after some toughs encourage him to leave to which they get their skulls cracked for their efforts carter begins unraveling the loosely threaded tapestry of lies surrounding his brother s untimely demise taking him from low level thugs and sleazy broads all the way up to a couple of local criminal bigwigs but not before snogging the mouthy landlady anything to shut her up i suppose along the way the plot becomes convoluted but the various bits of information eventually all lead to the same place a mobbed up pornographer among other things named kinnear osborne whose got strong ties to carter s bosses back in london who by the way are against carter s mucking about if only not to cause waves in the underworld community after all business is business once carter gets the straight dope he begins methodically setting things right taking his aggressions out various individuals involved a few of which end up dead determined to make those responsible every single one of them suffer for their transgressions thing is once you start messing about with established rackets you have to expect there to be reprisals and there are as it seems everyone is now out to get carter caine is about as good here as anything i ve seen him in and that s saying a lot he s a calm collected completely remorseless killer one certainly not afraid to get his hands dirty has no fear in terms of anything he does coming back to haunt him using any means at his disposal to achieve his goals that s not to say he does not care for anything he seems to have affection for his niece but he does not let these affections get in the way of his business to him the ends always appear to justify the means and those who get caught up along the way are not really his concern actually to hear tell it seemed carter and his brother did not get a long all that well and the real rub for carter in his brother s death was more or less a disrespect of carter himself in one scene we see the result of an acquaintance catching a thrashing as the man s now laid up in his flat and carter makes light of the situation by offering him a wad of money telling him to use it for karate lessons and this guy was supposed to be one of carter s friends in carter s defense his world is pretty much limited to slimy underworld types so obviously it would not pay to get too close to anyone in terms of interpersonal relationships there s a real sense throughout he only cultivates relationships in order to further his own ends and once that s achieved he cares little what happens afterwards i really loved the scenes when carter first returned home it s not that he was all full of swagger and such but his presence did sort of command a level of respect from those who saw him for what he was a local who had made enough of a name form himself to move on to bigger and better things but never denied his humble beginnings as far as the rest of the performers they re all solid and very capable providing the proper support but this is caine s film and he carries it well the first time i saw this film a few years ago the pacing felt slow but watching it again last night i ve since decided it s more deliberate than slow what s the difference well i ll tell you i found myself keenly interested caine s character sure he was a bad dude but he was a bad dude with a purpose and while the plot was convoluted at times i believed it to be intentionally so mirroring the very realistic fact things are not always cut and dry black and white one aspect of this feature that stands out is the locations used for the filming newcastle is presented as a dingy depressing town of decay one that once bustled with industrial life but has since fallen into a state of continual disrepair its carcass dominated by criminal elements even the newer structures all seem imbued with the stale stink of poverty providing an appropriate backdrop for the story and capturing a real moment in time so to speak all in all an under rated first class thriller edgy british crime drama worth checking out if you re into that sort of thing the picture presented in anamorphic widescreen 1 74 1 looks decent but does exhibit some of the minor flaws one might expect from a film released in 1971 as far as the dolby digital mono audio it does come through well enough but does seem lacking in some areas as far as extras there is a commentary track featuring michael caine director mike hodges and cinematographer wolfgang suschitzky along with a theatrical trailer a brief biography of caine a music only audio track and english and french subtitles cookieman108by the way sylvester stallone appeared in a rather dismal remake comparatively speaking of this film with the

vengeance which results in captain amazing s capture like most metropolises that have become dependent upon the aid of a superhero for protection tranquility and general peace of mind capital city suddenly finds itself in a world of hurt without captain amazing s services fortunately for the ragtag group of amateur heroes that will become known as the mystery men the opportunity to unite and

macy blue raja hank azaria bowler janeane garofalo invisible boy kel mitchell and the spleen played flawlessly by one pee wee herman paul reubens make up the group of good guys under the tutelage of the hilariously generic advice dispensing sage sphinx wes studi if the names alone do not clue you in to the sheer zaniness of this justice league wannabe perhaps some of the powers will blue raja has mastered the art of throwing silverware spleen due to a spell placed upon him some years earlier by a gypsy has an incurable case of flatulence and mr furious well let s just say that sometimes life makes him grumpy perhaps most amusing of all would be the shoveler s origin story which just so happens to be that he has always been good at shoveling on that note one of the all time classic scenes of the film belongs to mr furious who thanks to a fantastically dry portrayal by ben stiller hopes to prove his true furiousness in a scuffle with the villains and ends up doing little more than pounding the hood of casanova frankenstein s stretch corvette stingray limo especially funny when he tries unsuccessfully to remove the hood ornament coming in at a runtime of 122 minutes the 2004 dvd release of the film contains some surprisingly solid extra features among these spotlight on location deleted scenes origin of the original mystery men comic book characters universal soundtrack presentation music highlights universal showcase a host of dvd rom features of particular note the movie itself is based loosely on an independent comic book series called flaming carrot comics by bob burden though some characters were greatly changed from the original material living up to the title the flaming carrot was actually a member of the team and because the team in the comics had an unusually high casualty rate nearly all of the heroes that appear in the film there is one scene where local heroes are interviewed for a spot on the squad were made official members at one point or another first and apparently last time film director kinka usher confesses to have come into the project with a background in television commercials and fortunately the film reveals no hint of the fast choppy cuts famous in tv advertising back in the late 1990s pacing however is certainly not one of usher s strong points a fact reveled here by a 122 minute runtime that somehow manages to completely avoid back story or character development of any kind granted many of the characters appearing here would only lose cache were we to delve too deep into their past like blue raja for example who lives at home with his mom wears a blue bathrobe for his costume and throws silverware the film is not a spoof so much as it is a satirical look at the entire superhero genre as such it relies more on sociological gags and sublime commentary than it does specific jokes this is not a bad thing as the world can really do without another film poking fun of superman directly of course the downside to this is that a certain degree of comic book geekdom is expected out of its viewers at the very least some degree of the popular trends that have adorned the pages of comic books for decades is required to appreciate the multitude of gags and quotes scattered about in mystery men s prose while it would be a stretch to go as far as to say this is a universally appealing film the fact of the matter is that it appears that most view it as a love it or hate it affair in defense of the former and especially thanks to stiller s character there is undeniable charm to this film that many of the superhero spoofs mentioned above fail to capture despite advances in computer generated imagery on the other hand it is easy to understand why some could lean toward the latter the humor is by no means consistent throughout and some moments of the film are not quite discernable between stabs at humor or attempts at seriousness the end of the film in particular starts to shake the parody feel altogether in favor of a bit of a clich eacute hollywood inspired finale however the sublime elements of the characters especially make it a worthy time investment fans of superhero entertainment in any capacity should definitely consider giving it a go if even only as a rental for the few genuinely humorous moments along the way after all the ridiculousness of superheroism works best when celebrated and mystery men is nothing if not a celebration of the preposterous',\n",

       " 'when i first came across across the universe it looked a little esoteric even with the musical pedigree of the beatles but from the first minute when jim sturgess sings girl it all makes sense you have to really respect how well the beatles musical legacy has been woven into this effort lennon mccartney harrison and starr made some of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a nice movie across the universe really puts that into focus the power of the songs comes alive at every turn vividly imagined with beautiful art direction and cinematography across the universe expertly weaves the beatles into the socio political context of the times the songs were written in hats off to director julie taymor and team who clearly thought this out very well and the excellent cast who all sing better than anyone would expect this is quite a feat considering that it could have come off cheesily or poorly done actor sturgess reminds me of a young paul mccartney but that s where the resemblance to anything beatles ends it s a pity across the universe did not succeed as well in the theatres but i suspect that the treatment may have been too intelligent for today s audiences it s a movie that comes from the heart that every beatles fan should watch and those curious about the music can check out',\n",
       " 'amazon is still combining movie reviews there are about half of dozen dvd versions of the snows of kilimanjaro amazon combines all of these reviews so whether you get a dvd with excellent quality or terrible quality all those reviews are applied to all of the versions of the dvd available for sale i purchased the most expensive one the snows of kilimanjaro remastered edition and the quality is terrible it looks like the movie was shot through a dirty window the dvd case has black trim and shows ava gardner and gregoty peck sitting at a dinner table avoid this version i will now try purchasing other versions of this movie from amazon i m hoping to find the one and only good one i read all of the other reviews and was not able to reliably determine which one is the official studio release amazon s policy of combining movie reviews is financially wasteful and damaging to the environment update buy the one with the red brown border mountain peaks are visible above ava gardner and gregoty peck on the case cover this dvd looks great',\n",
       " 'first i want to thank all the reviewers here it is their reviews of this fine film that tempted me to purchase it that and the fact that the director also did breaker morant a favorite of mine i m a big fan of this genre i loved dances with wolves and jeremiah johnson and i really enjoyed the last of the mohicans and last of the dogmen yet none of these excellent movies compare with the absolute realism depicted in black robe this is a simple story set in the early seventeenth century a story of a french jesuit priest who has been charged by his superiors to canoe to a huron outpost 1500 miles away with the aid of indian scouts and an interpreter and help convert the huron indians to christianity thus saving their souls in this movie the protagonist is not some superhero who makes no mistakes shows no weaknesses can out shoot and out ride any man alive on the contrary he is just a young priest filled with self righteousness ignorance fear and doubt but despite this or because of this his bravery is truly unparalleled this is a story of real people fighting for their lives every single day against the breathtaking harshness of nature and against other indian tribes this is also a story about the clash between two widely varied cultures this is shown with an uncanny subtlety yet the effects are devastating black robe goes where few movies have gone before or since it is a movie as oscar worthy as any i have ever seen the cinematography is bleak cold and unforgiving as is the story between 1 and 10 i give this landmark film a solid 9 it truly is one of my favorites',\n",

       " 'this is a blatant rip off by amazon playing on the current popularity of bradley cooper and hoping that no one will research past the 2 minute preview u get online to find out about the movie i later found out that the movie is an indie film that was done in 2002 the worst part was they charged a hd quality price of 4 99 for a grainy low budget film the lead character is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it s the norm to create an illusion and rip the suckers off and that s exactly what i feel happened here',\n",
       " 'this had to be the most painful dvd experience i ve ever had the music on tis dvd was so idiotic it drowned out everything making it completely incomprehensible equally as bad as the music the producer seemed to want video of himself walking about in almost every shot not to mention almost the entire dvd is made up of collages of images superimposed on top of one another making none of them clear enough to even see correctly i ve bought hundreds of books and dvd s from amazon and this is the first that has motivated me to actually post a review it is that bad i can not even comment on what the producer said i could not hear any of it stay away would be my advice a total waste of money',\n",
       " 'i enjoy good asian movies particularly when takeshi kaneshiro is in one but he is not in this movie i did not see aaron either i really wish i d read the reviews before buying and i will from now on just to make sure the character s listed are actually in the movie now who would have thought that was necessary of course i could tell from the cover that he was not going to be the lead character which was fine with me but i should ve realized he s not the caliber of actor that is not on the cover any more is it possible that when they say the movie is by takeshi they mean he produced it i m so clueless and annoyed with their misleading information i could almost scream if they had t lied about the cast i would not have bought this at all it s obviously a television drama edited quite poorly with lots of action wuxia wire action included good looking actors and a somewhat confusing plot if it s a sequel i suppose that explains some of the problems because people pop in and the main characters know them but we ve no idea who they are or if they re bad or good though we assume they must be friends or enemies or both depending upon their actions at one point they re all together a la power rangers forming a giant sword and i did not have a clue who they were or how wind even got there working to help the bad guy i also did not realize wave was the brother of cloud i think until much later in the story it would have packed much more of an emotional punch if i d known from the beginning but maybe because i was so bored it got past me somehow when wind becomes a demon there s no explanation as to how long or when he changes back to normal or even how he s with mung his wife one minute then not the next she adopts a boy and then he s never seen again until it s his cue to warn her inadvertently that the master has a cold behind it s just a hodge podge of scenes thrown together that leave you wondering how he or she did got so and so i would not recommend this movie at all it s filmed more like a soap opera has that video feel to it and it s simply edited horribly i was bored waiting to see when takeshi would appear thinking perhaps he was the nameless one but i could not even figure out who the nameless one was maybe if they d followed through with that whoever they wanted as the nameless one it might have given it more of a punch a perfect way to waste one s time',\n",
       " 'lewis gilbert s 1983 masterpiece a sensitive and emotionally satisfying adaptation of willy russel s intelligent and insightful two character play gilbert and russel would team up again for the wonderful shirley valentine but their work in this film remains unparalleled michael caine gives one of the most memorable performances in an illustrious career disappearing into his frank character and julie walters is magnificent as rita susan the music by david hentschel is perfectly appropriate the cinematography by frank watts is inspired the script is both touching and honest but the magic of this film is in the interplay between the two main characters this film captures the journey towards self awareness embodied in education as the rita susan character develops from hairdresser to student intellectual dilitante and finally into someone very different than at the start of the film yet still undeniably and uniquely rita the greatest gift one person can give another is the love of learning and thus i feel this is among the greatest love stories ever committed to celluloid the ending might be as inevitable as tragedy in the words of willy russel but the relationship between frank and rita made their emotional journey worthwhile and we are all the richer for their trip',\n",
       " 'if daniel barenboim is not the world s greatest living classical musician he is certainly the most versatile in a career spanning more than 50 years his name is attached to many of the celebrated recordings of opera symphony small ensemble and piano solo with the later half of his career marked by distinction at the podium one may forget that he is still an accomplished concert pianist here we are treated to both talents as barenboim conducts the staatskapelle berlin and plays all five of beethoven s piano concerti from the accompanying booklet we find that barenboim first recorded these works in 1967 at the age of 24 under otto klemperer now he is revisiting them 40 years later on the occasion of his 65th birthday the challenges of serving as conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable but barenboim performing entirely from memory and without a score makes it look easy and natural even while fully engaged in his role as soloist barenboim never loses command of the orchestra sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a sweeping gesture of his left hand at other times it s the subtlety of his nod or the quickness of his eye the staatskapelle is perfectly attuned to these nuances and their playing is always on cue and never hesitant among the many highlights the wonderful exchange between piano and clarinet in the largo of the first concerto a thrilling account of the rondo vivace in the final movement of the fourth and all the beauty and majesty of the emperor the performance was recorded before a live audience during a three day piano festival in bochum germany in 2007 the concerts took place in the jahrhunderthalle which features an architectural design from a converted steel mill the minimalist interior with high ceiling and exposed steel beams forgoes the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls and the stuffy pretence that goes with it aesthetically the jahrhunderthalle stands as a venue that emphasizes comfort and clean sight lines above all the sold out audience is appreciative and respectful of the music they are often in view but rarely heard even between movements until their applause at the end of each work they are smartly if not formally attired people who know good classical music when they hear it some of the performances took place during daylight hours allowing the large rear windows to cast a gorgeous natural light on the audience as well as the performers who are further illuminated by soft stage lighting that highlights the musicians and their instruments where needed and without any harsh shadows the 1080i blu ray image is near flawless skin tones are natural and appealing the color of the instruments and the audience attire is accurate with no bleeding the ivory keyboard is properly exposed and balanced with plenty of resolution to see the distinction between keys the black levels are strong without losing any detail in the jacket creases of the musicians close ups reveal the polished brass of the french horns as well as the fine grain in the basses and violins barenboim is appropriately the center of attention and we can see the delicate wisps of his hair and the beads of perspiration that begin to glisten on his forehead by the third movement of each concerto the pcm 2 0 audio track is clean but the piano sounds a little harsh above high c by contrast the dts hd ma 5 1 track by opening up the ambience of the rear channels and a broader soundstage delivers a beautiful sound that is warm and spacious and devoid of any discordance in the upper register the piano is properly centered while the sonic integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction according to its location on stage the full program runs at approximately 3 20 there are no supplements save for a handful of trailers of other medici arts releases an interview with barenboim some rehearsal footage and a short history of the venue would have been nice but unfortunately were opportunities missed in the end that s the only thing missing as this is in every other way a most welcome release and another grand achievement for one of classical music s most distinguished artists']"
