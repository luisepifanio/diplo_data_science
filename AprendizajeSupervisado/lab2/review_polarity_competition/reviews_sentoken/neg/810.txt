Ive been waiting for many years for this movie to be re-released ! And although Im happy to own it , I got SO mad while watching it ! I used to have most the lines memorized , so although I can not quote the full extent of the missing footage , it BOGGLES and enrages me as to why they removed some lines . Not only that , but the moron editor even muted a scene ! I dont know what issues he had with the main female character , but they must have been severe . I wish I had the director 's son address so I could send him some hate mail or perhaps even some roadkill in a box.If you release a movie , and this is what the fans have come to know and love , you DONT MESS WITH IT .
