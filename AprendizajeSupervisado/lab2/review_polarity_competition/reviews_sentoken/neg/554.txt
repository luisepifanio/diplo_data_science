This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I 've ever seen , and that 's saying quite a lot actually . It 's never a good sign when the best acting in a film comes from prostitutes hired to act as , yep , you guessed it , prostitutes . Everyone else just seemed to show up to earn an easy pay check by putting on the costumes and playing with the geysers of blood during the so-called action sequences . The only saving grace was the fact that it was so bad you just could n't help but laugh at it and wonder , was Michael Madsen really drunk throughout the entire shooting of the film ? If it 's really true it would go a long way for explaining how bad his performance was , and if that 's the case , maybe the rest of the cast was quietly joining him.Anyways , I 've never played the video games , so I ca n't really compare it to that , all I can say is that as a stand alone film it was a waste of money making .
