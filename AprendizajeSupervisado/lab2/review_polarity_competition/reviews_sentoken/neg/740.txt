As a lover of ancient history , I was excited to watch yet ANOTHER film on the life of Cleopatra . This film is extremely glamourous , and seems as if it follows the script of an ancient soap opera rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt . The filmmakers obviously did n't create this to be a factual account of Cleo 's life . The acting by Billy Zane ( Antony ) and Timothy Dalton ( Caesar ) was very good , and Lenor Varella ( Cleopatra ) provides a good show , if you like passion and overdone drama . If you want to see a fictionalized and modern televison view of Cleopatra 's life , than this is your movie , but the Cleopatra movie starring Elizabeth Taylor is far superior .
