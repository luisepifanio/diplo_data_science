I thought that I had found a gem ... .A DVD set that covered performances of one of the pioneers of metal ... the early years of one of the greatest bands ever . Um ... no . Someone is putting out a deliberate deception of Deep Purple DVDs that seem to suggest that you 'll get live performances , but all you really get is a lot of strangers reminiscing about the band.The very few performances that you get on any of these dogs have terrible A/V quality . My expectations were never high regarding the A/V based on when they were recorded . But the big problem is that THERE ARE HARDLY ANY PERFORMANCES . These Critical Review series are DVDs of interviews with bunch of people that maybe knew the band.And with the performances ( mostly cut up out-takes ) that you do get , you start screaming at the TV to show the dang performers ; the clips show things like the audience , the moon or the sky as the band plays.The price of this release is a joke for the rubbish content that you get . This piece of crap is n't even worth 1 buck in my opinion for the relatively uninteresting Deep Purple items of info that you get throughout the set.Deep Purple fans do n't be fooled . Go with Live In Concert 72/73 ( although unfortunately mostly in black and white ) and/or Live in California '74 if you liked the Coverdale/Burn years . But by all means keep away from the Add to Cart button here .
