( ... ) , you 've heard from other reviewers , this is a sucky full frame edition that looks like was made from old VHS master . So save your money and watch your old tape . Or , you can purchase a region 2 edition of this movie from Amazon UK , which is in widescreen presentation . I bought mine a year ago and have enjoyed it numerous times . But you 'll need an all-region DVD player for that . Look online for them . They do n't cost much more than a regular R1 player .
