This movie is in English with its major star being an American . However it is a collaborative Japanese effort . As essentially a Japanese horror film , it has some things in common with `` The Grudge . '' Here again , we have a haunting who delivers the chills by having her face curtained with hanging hair . I 'm not sure why hiding an apparition behind strands of hair is so eerie an effect - but it is.Also , the premise of driving along a lonely road at night is eerie in and of itself . And when you have a dead body in the trunk of your car - the ride becomes doubly fraught with danger.The acting is generally wooden . The actress who plays one of the lead love interests is Japanese with a very limited , stilted command of the English language . With so many actors eagerly available to appear in films , I do n't know why they ca n't find some better talent.So , this film is n't very memorable . But it is n't a complete waste of time . It will make you think twice the next time you load a dead body into your car and head off towards the nearest lake to dispose of it . You 'll realize you might just be in for some night terrors along the way .
