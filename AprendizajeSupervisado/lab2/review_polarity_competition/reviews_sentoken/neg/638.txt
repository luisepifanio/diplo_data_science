I love a good '70s cb radio movie as much as the next person and I really love this movie . However , this dvd is of very poor quality-it looks like it was taped off an old tv set and the sound is not synched with the picture . I could n't watch it . It was put out by a company called Cheezy Flicks . I wo n't be buying anything else they put out . Let 's hope some other company does a professional job of transferring this fun movie onto a dvd ... how hard could it really be ? ? ?
