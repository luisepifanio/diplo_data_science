How to ruin a perfectly marvelous movie ? Make a poor quality DVD . The picture is so washed out most details are lost and the sound so low I had to turn up the volume to 99 just to hear it whisper . THIS DVD IS VERY BAD ! Please just record this gem the next time it comes on TCM and save your money . It is a shame such a wonderful film has been treated in such a poor manner .
