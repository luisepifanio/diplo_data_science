I agree 100 % with another reviewer 's comments ... If you love this film , do not buy this DVD . This version is terrible . I watched it one time and wanted to take the disc outside , lay it on my driveway , and run over it with my car - repeatedly . Go back to editing school , Bill Jones . Truly insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie . I 'd give it negative stars if I could .
