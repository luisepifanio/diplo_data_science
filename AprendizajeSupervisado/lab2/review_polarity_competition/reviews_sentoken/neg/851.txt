I rented this knowing it was n't actually gon na have a real fight of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan , just a lotta clips . But I 'm 18 years old , still in high school , and have editing equipment and I could of made a whole lot better film than this . Honestly , what is this ? It 's downright horrible . You see Jackie Chan in Young Master and then Twin Dragons , and that 's it ! Than a little bit of Bruce Lee in about 2 or maybe 3 films and that 's it ! It never even shows them off , you only see Jackie do one descent stunt when he runs over the car and that 's it , where as a real film on this subject would show just about all his big stunts . And everyone knows Enter the Dragon is the place where to find some of Bruce Lee 's best work , and you do n't see anything from it . WHAT IS THIS ?
