It 's the same DVD as Death By Decibels .. Read those reviews.The producers put out the same DVD , which BTW has little to do with the band , under several different titles with different covers in order to rip-off the fans of a band the producers have nothing to do with . The cover gives you no clue that the Deftones are not on this DVD.I also got ripped off by buying the same Muse DVD twice by producers who had nothing to do with the band.In future I will be reading the review of a music DVD before buying from a music store.This sort of crap only serves to hurt the bands , the music stores and the music industry in general . As a fan , I feel like I 've been ripped off and will get stuff from the Internet for free instead , so ensuring that I do n't waste my hard-earned money.Les .
