If this knockoff DVD is indeed the version with James Stewart and Doris Day , then it is a pirated version ! Do NOT buy ! Go buy the Universal Home Video version , which - you will note - 57 % of readers had the good sense to buy after viewing this product.If it is not the 1956 , then STILL do not buy ! If it is the 1934 version , then the video company used the false advertising of putting Stewart 's and Day 's photo on the cover to trick you into buying !
