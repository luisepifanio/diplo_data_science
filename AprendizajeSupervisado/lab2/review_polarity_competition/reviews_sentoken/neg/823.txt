I have never written a review before , but after trying this video I felt obligated to warn others how misleading the title of this video is.This video is way too intense for anyone that has neck or shoulder pain . I have a lot of pain in the neck and shoulders and this video just makes it worse . Anyone with severe muscle tension needs yoga with a lot of stretching for those tight areas- this video is NOT it ! The video starts off with pushups and several weight bearing poses placing a lot of stress on the neck and shoulders ( such as plank and downward dog ) . This is a very fast paced video - it is more of a power yoga flow , definitely not something that will `` rescue your neck and shoulders '' ! ! ! ! ! She alternates in and out of weight bearing poses very , very quickly and there is almost no stretching in this video ! She does n't explain the poses at all and moves way too fast . This video is for advanced power yogies and definitely not for beginners or for anyone that has any type of pain . I am not a beginner , but I do have a lot of neck/shoulder pain and this video is completely inappropriate.There are other reasons too why this video is annoying ( but these are of much less importance ) : the music is annoying ( it sounds like some kind of voodoo music ) , the background scenery is nauseating and she is very fake.If you are looking for a good video to help with neck and shoulder tension , try `` Yoga for Stress Relief '' with Barbara Benagh , it is excellent ! This video allows you to choose from various sequences depending on what type of pain you have , and you can choose if you want an active flow or a more passive flow .
