Great Story ! 5 StarsGreat Actors ! 5 StarsGreat Director ! 5 StarsGreat Sci-Fi Movie ! 5 StarsGreat on DVD ? NO , NO , NO ! ! ! Zero Stars ! ! ! Non-Anamorphic , Non-16x9 Widescreen , Very Poor Video Transfer onto DVD , and Not on Blu-Ray yet ? What the # $ % * ! We are living in an age of HD 16x9 TV 's and this , one of the great emotionally moving Sci-Fi movies of our time is placed on DVD that is formatted for a 4x3 Standard Definition TV 's ? You have got to be kidding me.Hey James Cameron and Paramount or whoever is involved in the process of bringing this great movie to DVD , WE WANT THIS MOVIE IN 16x9 HD Format OR if you wo n't do that , how about a regular DVD in 16x9 Format/Anamorphic and why do n't you throw in a remastered video transfer while you 're at it so WE CAN ALL enjoy this movie on our 16x9 Widescreen Plasma , LCD , and LED TV 's and Projectors ! ! ! What a shame .
