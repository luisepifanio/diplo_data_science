This is two episodes of Shirley Temple 's Storybook theatre series . IMDB lists the Babes in Toyland episode as from 1960 . It stars Angela Cartwright , Jonathan Winters , Joe Besser , Jerry Colonna , and of course , Shirley Temple . Compared to the Disney version from '61 or '62 , this is a much weaker show . It 's also not as good as Laurel and Hardy 's version ( aka March of the Wooden Soldiers ) from the 30's.The main value of this DVD is as an example of a simpler time , when television could get away with simple ( think high school production values ) sets , minimal writing and acting , and call it entertainment . The storyline bears little resemblance to any version of Babes in Toyland I 've seen . The dancers seem under rehearsed , and the actors mug shamelessly . The child actors have to hold back laughter at the adults ' antics and prop failures.The Winnie the Pooh segment is a little better , done with marionettes by Bill and Cora Baird , who did the `` Lonely Goatherd '' sequence in Sound of Music . It would be fine for kids to watch .
