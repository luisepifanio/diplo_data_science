I have very little to say about this waste of time except that it features perhaps the worst Special Effects shot I have ever seen . Watch for it at the end when the park owner is under the faux sabretooth statue thing on top of the gift shop . WOW ! One other note , it is mentioned that the sabretooths are `` bulimic '' because they ca n't keep their food down . A ) they seem pretty healthy as they kill with wild abandon , including decapitations B ) is n't bulima more of a psychological disorder rather than a physical by product of cloning ? Or are the sabretooths ( Sabreteeth ? ) embarrased by their body image and force themselves into the `` binge and purge '' cycle ?
