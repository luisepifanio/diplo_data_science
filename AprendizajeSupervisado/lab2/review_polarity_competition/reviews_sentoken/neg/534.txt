I bougth this tape because I love the Firm tapes I own , the older ones.This tape was a major disappointment for me . I did not get a sweat out of this tape but , at the same time I could not follow through with them . They go from one step to another , as if you rehearsed each step with them for six weeks before the shot the tape.I was totally uncoordinated . They were doing one step , then another , and another , and I was still trying to figure out the first step . Doing this workout I felt like a chicken with my head cut off.I will just stick with their streingth training tapes . Those are awesome , and they really do tone you ! For cardio , I would recommend the one hour Tae-Bo 's . They are easier to follow . You work out a heavy sweat and he actually explaines each step before going to another .
