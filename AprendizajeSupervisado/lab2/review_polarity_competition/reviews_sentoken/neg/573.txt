This is a film I remember fondly , but was very disappointed with this transfer ( from 905 Entertainment ) ; the colours are faded and the soundtrack very coarsened and almost unlistenable - indeed , the very opening of Vaughan Williams ' superlative score has been clipped in this version . There 's now a far superior transfer available from Optimum Classic as part of their Easling Studios Collection - on sale from amazon.co.uk : vibrant colours and a much better soundtrack , so the extra dollars for that version are worth it !
