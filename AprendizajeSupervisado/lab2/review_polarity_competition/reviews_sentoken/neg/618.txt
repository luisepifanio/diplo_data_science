I bought this DVD expecting to see some of my favorite episodes , and yes some of the episodes are uncut . But overall the picture quality is terrible , additionally one of my favorite episodes ( the one with the English Butler ) is missing 5 critical minutes of he episode where the butler talks about how he likes staying with Andy and Opie , but overhears Andy and Barney talking on the porch that night . The scene obviously is missing when the butler just disappears right in the middle of the episode.Watch TV land instead , and you 'll get a better quality result .
