This review is to point out that this version ( Westlake Entertainment ) of Escape from Sobibor ( which is a great docudrama ) is NOT the uncut 143 minute version as indicated in the Amazon listing and also indicated on the DVD cover . In fact , it is the 120 minute version offered by many other distributors . In addition , the transfer on this Weslake version is not great . I have the TGG/Diamond version ( also 120 minutes ) which is a much better transfer .
