Pick another version at all costs ! My wife wanted this movie since she loved the first one so much . She had read somewhere that this version was very good and she could not have been more wrong . The transfer is horribly washed out . Needless to say we will NEVER purchase a SYNERGY version again.I wish I could give it 0 Stars.Too bad a good movie was ruined by such a lousy DVD . UGH !
