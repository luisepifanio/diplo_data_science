This was supposed to be a Televista re-release of one of the best TV movies of all time , Raid On Entebbe . They wanted twenty bux , but I took a chance . Amazon did n't ship me what they had listed , but some junk product by `` Wham ! USA '' . It was region-free , which is usually a bad omen portending a trash-quality Chinese bootleg that looks like it was filmed with a handheld , dirty-lens , cheap camcorder . It lived up to that terrifying description.I watched about 30 ghastly seconds of this shabby disc ( which also came with a lot of small scratches and a few pits here and there ) and then logged on to request an RMA and print a return label . Do n't touch this `` Wham ! USA '' garbage with a 10-foot pole .
