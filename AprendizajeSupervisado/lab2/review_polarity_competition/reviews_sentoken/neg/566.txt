Like so many others reviewing this DVD , I absolutely loved the TV show and hunted for recordings of it . What is so disappointing is that this DVD is a collection of shows and not the series from the beginning . Some Cybill and MaryAnn is better than none , but how releasing all of the episodes from beginning to end ?
