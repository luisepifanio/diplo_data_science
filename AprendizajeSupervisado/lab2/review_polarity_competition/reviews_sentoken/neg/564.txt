For those of you that have read the wonderful novel this movie was 'based ' on , the only advice i can give you is dont see it . I couldnt even bring myself to watch the whole movie- halfway through i turned it off . The acting is really not up to par , the 'bad guy ' seems about as menacing as a wet kitten , and worst of all the only thing the movie shares in common with the book are character names , and thats about it . Hollywood slaughtered the novel in every way shape and form . I havent been this disappointed in a book turned movie since the Eragon movie came out.For those of you that havent read the book , this might be a decent movie , albeit seriously corny ( her working in a chocolate shop ? ? C'mon , there had to be SOMETHING more creative there for the blood and chocolate theme ) .
