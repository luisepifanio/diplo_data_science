As an ultimate fan of Lynch 's work , I am really shocked by this dismal Canadian edition of the truly magnificent Lost Highway - Lynch 's truly & quot ; grande oeuvre & quot ; . It 's a shame , to say the least , that such a piece of art could be demeaned in such a way by the horrid quality of this recording . And I certainly ca n't believe Lynch himself would have approved of this outrage . Get the film by all means , but please do n't buy this DVD !
