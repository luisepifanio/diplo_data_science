Warner Brothers again proves to us that when they do n't care , THEY DO N'T CARE . It is n't just a lack of extras , its a lack of ... um ... PART OF THE MOVIE . That 's right ! part of the audio track is gone . Those elvish blades that previously had their own sound effects are gone and many creatures that use to scream when they got killed ( can you blame them ? ) now die without a whimper . This is a film I 'd normally give a 4 or even a five star , but WB has pumped this thing out without even bothering to check the sound mix , or perhaps they have edited it in some manner incomprehensible to me . For whatever the reason , you 'd almost be better buying the VHS as you 'll have the complete soundtrack and it probably looks nearly as good . And let 's not even discuss the terrible cover they 've stuck on the film . All in all , WB should be ashamed by their overflowing apathy -- especially since we 'll probably never see another edition of this film without importing it ( should it be released in another country . )
