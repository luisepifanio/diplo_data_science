Oh my God ! I 'm looking for anything less than 1 star ... Anyone who has seen this DVD has got to be soooooo disappointed ! I really love Christina ( just ask my girlfriend ) and to watch this DVD was tooooo much to bare ! Five minutes into it and I screamed `` I GOT RIPPED OFF '' ! `` WARNING '' ... '' DO NOT BUY THIS DVD '' ! ! ! The only thing positive about the ordeal was I did n't purchase it online @ `` AMAZON.COM '' ! : ) If I had used my account I would have been forwarned by all you great `` AMAZON.COM MEMBERS '' ... I would have saved a few bucks and shed less tears ! It was total torture ! ! !
