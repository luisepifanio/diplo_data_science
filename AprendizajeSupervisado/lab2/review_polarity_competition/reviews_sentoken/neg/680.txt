I agree with everyone that the studios are once again ripping us off . The TV movies SHOULD be made available to all of the fans who already purchased the individual seasons . I believe that fans would even accept the tv movies as a `` disc only '' offer ( no packaging ) at a reasonable price ... for those contacting the studio.Regarding `` whole series '' box-sets ; I think it 's a good idea , but NOT an idea that truly works at the moment . My main complaint is the amount of discs and the non-standard ( LARGE ) boxes used for most series . Sure , it looks nice in the store and online , but it sure does n't fit nicely on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection . Try putting a couple `` complete series '' box sets on a shelf and see how quickly it starts to look ridiculous ! I prefer buying individual seasons , which fit nicely on a shelf ( with the rest of my collection ) and ussually have better packaging . Remember that some of the `` whole season '' box sets either have the discs laying on top of each other ( loose ) or simply sliding into little notches in cardboard ( which scratches the discs ) .The true answer for whole season sets will be the increased capacity of the BLU-RAY format . Less discs , nicer box ( standard size ) , etc . Until then , I plan to buy seasons individually.JM
