First off let me say I loved the movie . Loved it so much I purchased a digital copy to download and keep on my Kindle Fire . The problem came when according to Amazon tech help , DreamWorks decided they were not making enough sells in the DVD area , and blocked this from the streaming content on what they called a blackout period . Which in return caused Amazon to remove my purchased copy from my Kindle and block me from the streaming version . Amazon did return my money but it has made me very cautious about making future digital purchases . Just a warning to any buying digital movies from Dreamworks .
