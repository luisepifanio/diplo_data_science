I love this film , but the biggest problem I have is with the aspect ratio . I recently bought the film , not realizing it had been cut to a 1.33:1 from a 1.85:1 , and I ultimately feel like if I 'm paying for a film , I should own the entire thing.Shame on me for not reviewing the aspect ratio before purchase , but beyond that , it 's a great film minus the Coppola dribble in the middle .
