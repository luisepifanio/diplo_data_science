I was so excited when I heard Confession of a Shopaholic was going to be a movie because I absolutely love the books . Yes , the books are incredibly stupid , but I still think they 're cute and funny.Well , I missed the movie in theaters and kind of forgot about it until I was flipping through my on-demand listings tonight ( yes , 2 years later ! ) . I knew from the movie trailer/commercials that it was going to be different ( ie , Becky & co being American , set in NY , etc ) , but wow , I had no idea how different the movie would be . I feel like the differences really ruined the movie too . In the movie , Luke is a total schlub , works for a magazine , and there 's that whole fashion magazine thing . None of that happens in the books , nor do Suzy and Tarkie get married until later . It was a total train wreck.Do yourself a favor and read the books instead !
