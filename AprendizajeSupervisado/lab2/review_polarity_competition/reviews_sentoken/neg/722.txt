While this is an excellent adaptation of the first 24 chapters or so of J.K. Rowling 's book , the initial Harry Potter home video releases continue to disappoint with their stunningly skimpy bonus materials and lack of documentaries . It 's obvious that this film , including its current special features , will be released eventually as : 1 . An `` Ultimate Edition '' with new special features , 2 . In a `` Complete Movie Collection '' with all the other films , and 3 . Possibly as an `` Extended Edition '' combined with Part 2 . So why in the world would I be foolish enough to pay $ 15-25 for this now ? If you 're a die-hard fan who just ca n't wait to have this , I suppose I understand , but you should just rent it and save your money for later . Otherwise , this is a blatant attempt by Warner Bros. to continually screw people out of their money . And that 's not cool with me .
