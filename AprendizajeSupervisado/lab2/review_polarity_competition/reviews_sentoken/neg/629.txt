The DVD arrived without the customary shrink wrap , so I 'm not sure if I got a new or used product , even though it was sold as new . There were multiple light scratches on the disc , but it plays.The quality of the recording is bad , make that awful . The images are pixilated on my TV . I ca n't imagine how bad this would look if I tried to show it to my class projected onto the big screen . I do n't even consider that an option , even though that is why I bought the DVD.I 'll never buy anything else this video company produces .
