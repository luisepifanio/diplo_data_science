Great Movie ! I saw this movie on the Turner Classic Channel and fell in love with it . I ordered this version and the quality does n't even compare to the one on tv . It badly blurry/foggy and the sound is just down right terrible . The studio needs to release an official dvd for this film because it is truly one of Elizabeth Taylor 's best films along with Raintree County , BUtterfiled 8 , Giant , A Place in the Sun and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof . She is an outstanding actress , one of my faves ! ( one star for the dvd quality , 5 stars for the movie ! )
