Unless you can laugh along at horror schlock , are a huge fan of Louis Gossett Jr. , or are a fan of Richard Karn ( Al from & quot ; Home Improvement & quot ; ) , you probably will not like this movie at all . It drags along at a pace slower than a snail in hibernation . The dialogue is really , really , bad . This is one of those movies that you know that the only reason the actors , directors , producers , and anyone else associated with the film did it was because of the money . Richard Karn provides a few laughs as a swinging , single , archeologist and LG Jr is a bit frightening at times ( not because of his character , but because of his over-emoting ) . However , most of the time everyone in the film have these & quot ; how did I end up here & quot ; or & quot ; I ca n't wait until I 'm done with this & quot ; looks on their faces . By the way , did I mention there really is n't much plot until half-way through the film ? What makes this film worse is that it actually portrays itself as a serious scary movie . Give me a break ! Roger Corman knew he was making schlock and Ed Wood really did believe he was making good movies . The makers of this film ca n't plead either case . All in all do n't waste your time with this film , rent some other mummy movie .
