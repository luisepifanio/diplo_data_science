I thought this product was not useful . I would not purchase it if you are not an expert dancer or willing to put a lot of time into learning her dance moves . As with any workout I am sure it gets your heart rate up but because there are so many moves I became frustrated and put the dvd away out of sheer annoyance . I never put it back into the dvd player after that . I prefer a workout that has just a little bit of repetition so I can learn the steps in a fairly short amount of time , and actually get a work out on the first use .
