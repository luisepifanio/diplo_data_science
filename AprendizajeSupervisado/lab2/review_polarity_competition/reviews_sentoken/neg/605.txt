I agree with the first guy . This movie pack was not that great . I purchased it hoping to see some actual combat footage ( or any footage for that matter ) taken from the vietnam war . instead , each VHS which is supposed to specfically target one fighting aspect of the U.S. in vietnam ( i.e . the marines , the bombers , the navy , helicopters , etc ) just shows the same footage over and over . For instance , every video shows a diving helicopter shooting rockets and B-52s dropping bombs , which is cool the first time you see it but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realized you wasted your money .
