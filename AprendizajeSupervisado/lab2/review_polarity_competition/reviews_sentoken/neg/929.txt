I went into this movie trying to have an open mind , considering i had heard , at best , mixed things about it . But within the first 15 minutes , i knew it was a mistake to even give it a shot . It looks like a straight to video clunker , and that 's basically what it is . the plot is simple . A man driving down a lonely highway at night . There 's a love triangle gone awry and much speculation regarding what 's in the trunk , and why it 's there . But , frankly i did n't care about any of it . The acting is horrible , and the writing is laughable . So , trust me ... do n't even bother with this one .
