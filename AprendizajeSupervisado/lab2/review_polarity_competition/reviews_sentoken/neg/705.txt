Light years below the first two films in writing , directing and character developement . The movie was filled with holes in the plot that even my 9 y/o could see through . She thought it was funny in some places , but even then , most of the obvious set-ups for jokes where not funny and there where several mis-fires . She hated the spitting Llama who just plain drools and slobbers . Combined the slobbbering with his `` South American '' accent and it is hard to understand what he is saying most of the time . Elliot the deer is , by virtue of the story , a non-existant factor and the chemistry between him and Boog the bear that helped make the others successful is completely gone . The dialogue is meandering and forced . Do n't waste your money . Rent it or wait for it to come out on television .
