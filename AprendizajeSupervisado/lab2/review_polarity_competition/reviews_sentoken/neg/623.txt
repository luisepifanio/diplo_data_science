I do n't know who I feel sorry for more , Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater . Dorff , who is a great actor though you 'd never know it by the movies he 's in , has n't been in anything remotely good since the original Blade in 1998 . Slater 's career has gone downhill over the years , pretty much by taking part in some flop projects . Both actors sleepwalk through their roles in this latest video game to screen adaptation from director Uwe Boll , the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation , the incredibly bad House of the Dead . Alone in the Dark is n't much better , with a story so non-existant that you 'll be scratching your head wondering what 's going on before you pray for everyone to get killed . Tara Reid is also on board as the smart girl , and as previous reviewers mentioned , we know she 's smart because she wears glasses . There is n't one redeeming factor about Alone in the Dark , and if you subjected yourself to the travesty of House of the Dead , then you know what to expect here .
