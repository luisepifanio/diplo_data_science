Having played both `` BloodRayne '' games , I 'm a fan of the series . So when I heard they were making a movie , I was somewhat interested . But deep down , I knew it would probably suck.I was more than right.Unless you 're interested in a moive that is so terrible that it makes you laugh , DO NOT BUY THIS FILM ! It is a total disaster ! Movie Rayne is nothing like her videogame counterpart . The fight scenes were slow , nothing at all like the fluidity of the game . And do n't get me started on the gore ... I 've seen better setups in a walk-through haunted house . Nothing was done realistically , and the ten-minute recap at the end of the movie ( which was done for some reason I will never understand ) only displays how sloppy it is . The acting was n't great , either , and the brief sex scene ... lets just say I found myself laughing through most of this mess . Needless to day , the plot was also lacking ( and that 's putting it lightly ) .If you want a vampire flick , pick up the `` Underworld '' movies . If you 're a `` BloodRayne '' fan looking for something to satisfy your fandom , play the game over again . You 'll get more satisfaction out of it than you would this horrible rendition .
