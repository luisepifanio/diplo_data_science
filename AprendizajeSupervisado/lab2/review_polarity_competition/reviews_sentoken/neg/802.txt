The quality of this DVD is appalling , and virtually unwatchable . Althought I understand that the footage is old , I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography ! It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly , and due to the absence of audio in the clips ( the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end ) , the breathing can not be heard.The video is blurry , dark and visually & quot ; noisy & quot ; . The funeral scene at the end is so dark , it is difficult to see anything at all.Do n't waste your money
