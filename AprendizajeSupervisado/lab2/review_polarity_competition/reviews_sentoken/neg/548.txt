If you look at the fine print on this DVD , you 'll see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation . And boy does it show.The image quality of this DVD has all the earmarks of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie . They did n't even bother to use a new VHS tape -- judging by the grainy texture and the annoyingly prevalent flaws ( flickers , `` hairs '' on the screen , etc ) it was captured from an old copy of the tape . I have a VHS tape that has a better picture than this DVD.Everyone PLEASE write the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the shoddy release of this movie ! If we make ourselves heard , we might be able to convince them to release widescreen , Criterion quality releases of John Wayne 's less famous movies.UPDATE : PLEASE NOTE ! This review DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO THE SPECIAL EDITION.Amazon is mixing all the McLintock ! reviews in one bag.I do n't know what the quality of the Special Edition ( released in October 2005 ) is , but it is not necessarily the same as the previous editions .
