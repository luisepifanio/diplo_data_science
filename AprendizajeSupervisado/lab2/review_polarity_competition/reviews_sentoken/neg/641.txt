The box touts `` Digitally Mastered '' , well it 's not like you have the choice when converting from an analog video tape to a DVD , because that 's obviously what 's been done.They simply put together images from 20 year old footage . The image quality is mediocre at best , faded , yellowed and contrastless . You can actually see black spots and scratches on the image just like you would see on old B & W movies.This is really a DVD put together on the cheap : the `` Bonus Slideshow does not even work .
