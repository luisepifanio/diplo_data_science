Blood & Chocolate [ Region 99 ] This movie sucked . If you read the book , please save yourself the trauma of watching this ! ! ! The only thing that it did have from the book was the title and the names of characters . It truly traumatized me . My friend said that I sat for 2 1/2 hours saying `` what the hell happened ? They had the book ... what the hell happened ? '' Needless to say I liked the book and wish I had saved the $ 9 it cost to watch it in theatre . I should have asked for my money back , but I was too traumatized to think straight .
