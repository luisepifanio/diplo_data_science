Beware , Grossman plays the songs on this dvd , but never shows you how to play them . The tab is so different from the way he plays the songs that you have to learn them by ear . Inaccurate tab seem to be the norm with Grossman 's material . It 's really too bad , because he 's a great guitar player . I would love to sit down with Grossman and make him play these songs using the tab provided . Come on Stefan , buck up and proofread your material before you put it on the market .
