First of all I went into this with a very open mind . I was expecting to hear some out of this world stuff but instead what I got was this lady talking about why she thinks her son is special for like 45 min and then the rest is taken up by her son saying he is not special , He did seem to be genuine but the mother has that annoying attitude many mothers display when talking about their kids . To be fair they do share some interesting info but its only like 5 min worth to me .
