The ultimate editions of the Harry Potter series are out from movies 1-6 but nothing exists for Part 1 of Deathly Hallows or a pre-order option for an ultimate edition of Part 2 . Why not ? The other editions offered herein are simply repeats of the blu ray versions already out with a digital copy whereas the ultimate editions have different and extended special features . What are those of us interested in having a complete set of the ultimate editions supposed to do ? Sit and wait to see if they come out ( even though Part 1 was released a long time ago and there has been plenty of time to produce an `` ultimate edition '' ) ? If they never come out , we do not have a complete set of ultimate editions - a true disappointment and a waste of the money spent on the other six versions of the films . Please , ca n't someone find out if Warner Brothers or whoever produces them are going to complete the series of ultimate editions ; in other words , create and sell the ultimate editions of Deathly Hallows ONE AND TWO without the badges , pins and other `` doo-dads '' that adult fans are not at all interested in obtaining ? JK Rowling wrote these books for ALL OF US so the publishers of the books , DVDs , etc . should be fair to all of us .
