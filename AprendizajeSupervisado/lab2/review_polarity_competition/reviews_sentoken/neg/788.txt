If you do n't have a multisystem TV and DVD player to utilize PAL , you can use a computer , PC with a DVD program or Mac to watch DVDs that you get from Amazon UK . I do n't know why , but the entire 5 seasons are available in the United Kingdom , and I thought that Ally McBeal was one of the most delightful televisions programs to come along in years , and was sad when it was canceled . The abreviated box set available in the U.S. using the NTSC format is just that -- - abreviated , and can not do justice to a great series . As an American , I think we deserve better . Having traveled with the USN extensively , I have a multisystem television and DVD player . But you can also use a MAC or PC to watch .
