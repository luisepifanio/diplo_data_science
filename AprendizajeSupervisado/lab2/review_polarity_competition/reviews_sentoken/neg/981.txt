This dvd has my favorite soundtrack for this film , however , it is out of sync with the video ! ( which basically ruins it ) The chapter selection is flawed also : there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from ; chapter 2 is labeled chapter 1 , and so on ... so there is no selection for chapter 1 . The title menu is also extremely cheap , showing a small photo of the cover of the dvd case on a background closely resembling the old windows 95 'blue sky with clouds ' background image . Last , and certainly not least , the video quality is terrible.This one probally is n't worth getting unless you 're planning on remastering the dvd with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use , and with a decent chapter selection menu . I hope to find that someone has already put a nice version together with this soundtrack on dvd ( I know it exists on vhs ) .
