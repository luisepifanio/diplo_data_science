I had the misfortune of sitting through the whole movie , and I began to contemplate gouging my eyes out . After the end credits , I sat in disbelief that I actually wasted 83 minutes of my life watching this piece of festering crap . I honestly do n't know how I have n't gone deaf , or at least insane at the sound of his incessant squeaking voice . If ever you find yourself in the same situation as I was , immediately leave the room . To Nickelodeon : I want my 83 minutes back .
