I am really a Christina fan but I have no choice on this one other than saying the truth . This is the WORST DVD I have ever bought in my life . I ca n't encourage anyone to buy this one . I do n't really know what Christina was thinking to release this DVD . There is no way I can call this a music video but rather call it a `` SLIDE DVD '' coz what you should expect to see are just slides about her biography and no music at all . I regret having bought this DVD . I repeat , DO N'T BUY THIS ONE ! ! ! This is really discouraging . Anyway if you have nothing to do with your money then you can buy this one . Better buy the Stripped one not this one .
