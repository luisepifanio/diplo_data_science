A sequel to director Ridley Scott 's `` Alien '' was inevitable , of course . This traditional horror movie set in outer space simply made too darn much money for the studio to simply let it stand alone.Surprisingly , when director James Cameron took over , he was determined to make a different movie rather than merely rehash the first . Thus , `` Aliens '' was adventurous , taking the story in new and exciting directions as an action-adventure yarn instead of another horror movie.Indeed , a number of critics feel `` Aliens '' is better than `` Alien . `` But now comes `` Alien 3 `` - as unnecessary a sequel to a major movie as we 've seen in some time . First-time director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror movie , attempting existential overtones as they make the alien in this film Ripley 's `` Moby Dick . `` But `` Alien 3 `` begins by changing the ending of its predecessor and knocking off nearly all the characters we cared about . Fans will recall that Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) , Hicks , Newt and the android Bishop escaped in a space ship at the end of `` Aliens . '' But this film begins with their being ejected from the ship and crash-landing on a prison planet , which kills all of them except Ripley ! On this maximum-security planet , where lice infestation requires everyone to be bald , Ripley finds that the lone surviving monster is still with them . Soon , she 's organizing the prisoners to be on the alert , but since there are no weapons of any kind on the entire planet , they wind up playing hide-and-seek with the creature for most of the movie.There are a lot of problems with this film , but the worst are its dreary , dark motif ; the lack of sympathetic characters ; the unpleasantness of the film 's premise , which has Ripley eventually discovering she has a queen alien growing inside of her ; and a lengthy chase sequence that is so dark , and edited so chaotically that it becomes confusing.Those looking for thrills or some enhancement to the first films will be very disappointed . Those looking for a headache will have come to the right place.And why is it `` Alien 3 ( i.e . cubed ) `` instead of simply `` Alien 3 '' or `` Alienz '' or `` Alien : One of Those Slobbering Monsters Survived After All '' ? It 's probably just a gimmick to get writers like me to ponder the question and give the film a little more ink . It worked .
