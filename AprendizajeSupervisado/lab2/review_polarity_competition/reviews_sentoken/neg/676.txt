I 'm not going to rip Hilary Duff apart like a previous reviewer because I actually think she was about the best part of this film , hence the one star . It 's fun and girly but I could n't enjoy it because of the constant stereotypes ( i.e . blonde girl enters the business world and does n't know anything apart from how to utilize colour , as well as the consistent way the female characters judge men by their 'hot abs ' or 'tight asses ' ) . It just seems a bit sexist in terms of both the male and female characters and , while I know most chick flicks are like this to some extent , it has never been to the extent that I 've felt the need to switch off . The English guy 's accent is laughable . Why do n't they just use English people to portray English people rather than people whose accent flips between Australian and American ? The other characters besides Lane are pretty rubbish and wooden , including her best friend and more or less all the people she works with . The story , I guess , is light-hearted and cutesy , but if you have an ounce of intellect and do n't assume that all women are bimbos whose specialist subject is coats and men 's worth is assessed by the tightness of their buns , I suggest looking elsewhere . I was also a little concerned about the sexual references ( i.e . painting each others bodies with chocolate and then 'burning it off ' after one date , talk of climaxing etc. ) . Surely that 's a bit much for a younger audience ?
