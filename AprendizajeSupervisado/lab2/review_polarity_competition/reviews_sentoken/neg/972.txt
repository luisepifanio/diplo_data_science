Imagine a documentary with a disclaimer that lets the viewer know that they will not hear ANY actual music of U2 during the film . Imagine a documentary with no interviews of any significance , especially not of band members , but one with interviews of exciting people like someone who knew of the band members at school in Ireland or of some people who saw them perform once . WOW ! I think the only people who should watch this documentary are those that want to dislike U2 . After hearing all the ridiculous pontification of these nobodys , I was beginning to question my own allegiance to this band . But fortunately , I remembered that it was UNAUTHORIZED and , at least in this case , meant , not scathing and edgy , but sappy and void of content . The discography was the only thing worth looking at .
