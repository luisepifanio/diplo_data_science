This is a great movie depicting the events of the hijack of Air France flight 139 and Operation Thunderbolt ( later named Operation Yonatan ) accurately and in great detail . The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and as the events unfold . I saw this movie on the History Channel , on Real to Reel hosted by Steve Gitland , and I enjoyed it so much that I went and bought the DVD here on Amazon . I received the 2007 remastered version distributed by WHAM ! USA . The quality of the picture is poor on this disc , but my biggest disappointment is that there are a number of memorable scenes missing . There is at least one noticeable jump-cut in the film.Some of the scenes that I saw on television but not on this DVD are as follows : - The part where they took the passports away from the hostages.- When Daniel Cooper 's son is informed by a French airport official about the fate of his father 's flight.- An exchange between two hostages about trying to get into view of the television cameras during one of Idi Amin 's visits.- All the scenes showing the released non-Israeli hostages returning home.- A catholic nun insisting on staying with the rest of the hostages.All of these memorable scenes , that I was looking forward to seeing again , are GONE ! Although the raid itself seems largely intact but the scenes are so dark I had to rely on the memory of the TV version of the film to know what was happening . All in all , Excellent movie , Bad DVD ! I will avoid all products of WHAM ! USA in the future .
