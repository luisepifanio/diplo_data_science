This movie is based on a true story , and I 've seen the original story on `` A Haunting . '' I was hoping that the movie version would give me a creepier version of the original story , but all I got was bad acting , a lackluster storyline , and terrible effects . It seemed as though the director had an excellent idea in his head , but could n't quite project it correctly . They tried way too hard to make the story `` better . '' As a result , the story came off as cheesy and over the top . If you want to get a better and more accurate version of the story , check out the `` A Haunting '' version .
