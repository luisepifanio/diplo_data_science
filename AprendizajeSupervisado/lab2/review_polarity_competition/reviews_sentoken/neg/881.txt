I got this DVD for my BDay , and being a huge MMA/UFC fan I was really excited . Then I watched the DVD , and my excitement turned to sheer dissapointment . If you own Ultimate Knockouts 1 through 4 , do n't buy this DVD , all the fights are on prior knockout dvds . There are only two new fights on this DVD that are n't on the others , Vera vs. `` Some Guy '' and Couture vs. Liddell 3 . Nothing else is new , there is no Gonzaga vs. Cro Cop , nothing past 2005 . I am beyond disappointed .
