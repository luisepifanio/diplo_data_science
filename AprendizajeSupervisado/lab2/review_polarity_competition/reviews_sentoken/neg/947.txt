I do n't know what to say to this mess of a movie . First off , I have not played the video game , but it would probably win an acadamy award before this movie would . What a discredit to probably a excellent video game . Yes it started like it might be cool , then people tried to act . What can I say , Michael Madsen ... It sounds like you never rehearsed and were reading off of cue cards . He just does n't fit this role . He just seems to keep the role of gangster in whatever movie he gets , never adapting his affect . Second , the dialog was weak , and the plot predictable . The love scene , what was the deal with that , what a cheap ploy to drag young men to theaters , drop a porn scene into any movie and walla , you might make your money back by releasing it as an unrated version . Just a horrible movie . I just hope some hollywood bigwig does n't get the big idea for a sequel , ouch , that hurts just to think of it . Do n't even bother ... sorry for all the seller here on amazon , this movie will probably hang around a while . So bad
