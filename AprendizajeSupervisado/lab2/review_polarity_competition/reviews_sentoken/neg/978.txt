Visual quality of this video is fair to average . The sound track is good . This is a 54 minute cut version of this title . The original theatrical release had a running time of approximately 75 minutes . Uncut versions of this film can be found in private film collections , but none are known to be available on home video . This 1944 release is one of the first 3 films Roy starred in with Dale Evans . It is too bad that this title is not available on video in its original full length form , as this is one of the better Roy Rogers films .
