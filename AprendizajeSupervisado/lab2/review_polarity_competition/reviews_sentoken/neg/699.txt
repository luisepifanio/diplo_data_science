The Abyss ( Special Edition ) is not the set that a proper cinephile would appreciate.I was so excited that this DVD was on sale at Best Buy for $ 9.99 that I immediately bought it . I put it in to play on my widescreen TV to find out that Fox did not set this DVD up to be played on HDTVs ! I have to set the picture in a 4:3 image to watch a film that is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.This set is utterly disappointing ! I would recommend that everyone wait for this to be released on BluRay . Only then will Fox actually make good on their `` special edition '' promise . At least , I hope they will ...
