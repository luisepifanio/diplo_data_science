Wow , what a bore . The old stock footage is uneven and does n't show enough of the truck . Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street . The song is OK , but once that 's over my son walks away . Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away ? Because some guy 's voice ( which sounds like it 's in an echo chamber ) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he ca n't SEE on the screen . What 's on the screen ? More garbage stock footage . This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone 's basement .
