Former government agent Edward Carnby ( Christian Slater ) must solve the mystery behind events that happened when he was a child in order to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters from another dimension.OK , I 'll admit , `` Alone in the Dark '' is not on my best films of all time list , but it 's not on my worst films list , either . It may be directed by Uwe Boll , who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time , but if all of Boll 's other films are like this , then Boll has been grossly underestimated , because I have seen a lot of films that are far worse than this one ( for example , `` The Stepford Wives '' remake ) .The script is based on a video game , which gives it that `` video game '' , moving from level to level , feel that you get with a lot of films of this type ( such as `` Resident Evil '' or `` Doom '' ) , but that did n't so much put me off the film as make me want to go out and play the game . Not being a gamer , this was my first encounter with `` Alone in the Dark '' , and I found the story to be interesting enough to maintain my interest for the duration of the film . The acting is uneven in quality . Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff ( as another government agent ) both turn in decent performances , but Tara Reid is so unconvincing as a scientist that she actually adds to the entertainment value of the film . My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are just too long . There is a fight scene at about the 1 hour mark that comprises about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue , which became tedious after a while . In spite of that , I still liked the film and would be prepared to watch it again .
