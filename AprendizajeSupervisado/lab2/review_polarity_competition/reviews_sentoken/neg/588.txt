This is a very well made and nicely shot sequel . The opening sequence and the sequences with the snipers firing indiscriminating at the fleeing crowd below were very memorable and well executed . However , I was completely bugged about how simple it was for the father to access his wife who was supposed to be in some type of quarantine . I know that there are often lapses in logic and suspensions of disbelief in many movies and I am guilty of succumbing to some of them . But this to me was a very glaring one .For crying out loud , either the US Military was completely incompetent or the filmmakers did n't think it would be that glaring to the audience . Who in their right mind not put the mother in quarantine with at least one guard at the door let alone a nurse or technician monitoring her ? ? ? ? ? ? Instead the facility was deserted . It was just too simple for the father to access her with a pass card or not . If a person was still found to be alive 28 weeks later with no symptoms in a quarantined zone in the real world , that person would be locked up and video monitored 24/7 for days if not weeks because they want to know how she survived and how she was `` immune '' to this virus . Such precautions would never be taken this lightly especially when you 're dealing with a virus that nearly wiped out a whole country ! If they did n't have strict protocals we would have been wiped out as a race a long time ago.The suspension of disbelief in this movie really prevented me from enjoying a pretty well made film .
