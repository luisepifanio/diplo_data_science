I love the first two Anne of Green Gables films . I first viewed them on PBS and had the original VHS tapes released by Disney . The first few DVD releases by Sullivan were of very poor audio and visual quality . This new - expensive - set gathers the four films together , all in 16x9 widescreen . I do not like the other two films , so I will comment only on the first two.These were originally filmed in 4x3 format , with television in mind ( I read that they may have played theatrically overseas ) . I 'm not an expert , but these new widescreen formats do look cropped . So , information is lost with these new transfers . Is that so bad ? Yes , because I feel the original aspect ratios of these films should be 4x3 ( or 1.33:1 ) as they were originally broadcasted . Worse though , the image quality seems to be so digitally scrubbed that a lot of detail that was originally visible is no longer visible . The audio seems OK ; the default is the original 2.0 stereo mix . Annoyingly , the closed captioning seems to have been done by nitwits . For the first film , the first disc ( thankfully , each movie has two discs ) has fairly good captioning . The second disc has the captioning all IN FULL CAPS , and is rife with errors . Very poor quality ! ! At this price point , I would not recommend fans to rebuy these films if they are already owned . However , as an FYI , I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and they said they have no plans to release the films on blu-ray .
