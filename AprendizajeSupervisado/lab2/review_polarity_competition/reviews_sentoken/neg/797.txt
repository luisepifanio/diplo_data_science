So I was expecting a good time . Turner as the writer and Michelle R. in it ... However , I was strongly disapointed . I could care less if prostitutes were used as part of the cast ( hell , getting paid to not screw some ugly guy ) , I do n't care that the plot was weak ( I 've watched lamer movies ) , but the acting , or lack thereof , was unbelievable ! ! ! While I was watching the commentary ( yes , I am a freak who watches those ) all I could think was that this movie would n't be too bad if there was no sound . Just hearing their voices was enough to make me cringe each time I listened . So if you are a glutten for punishment or just have to watch all movies that get horrible reviews then this is for you . Otherwise , skip it and find Michelle on Lost reruns or Turner on the L-Word .
