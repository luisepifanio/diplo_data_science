28 Days Later is such a well handled film in terms of suspense , acting and meaning , that every time I watch it I get more convinced that it will become a classic in the horror-sci fi genre . Not so with the `` sequel '' , which might be well directed by Fresnadillo , but it is not well structured as narrative , and it does not lend any valuable `` message '' to the audience . 28 Weeks Later incurs frequently in the mistake of insulting our intelligence . How can you explain that the husband of the survivor female who is detained in a security health facility can have access to the room encountering no guard , no medics , no soldier or vigilant personnel in the place ? There are not even cameras , in a situation in which the reappearance of the virus is feared and it is possible , after the diagnose made by the medical personnel of the female survivor . In fact , that is the key event that originates the virus breach . Besides , the film is so focused in bloodshed , vampire 's biting and running , that no meaningful dialogue is possible , preventing one to make any sense of the chaos . And what can you tell about the helicopter used as a mortal power saw for beheading dozens of zombies-vampires ? The least I can say is that the scene is the peak of sensationalism . And insisting about the meaning of the film , why such a valuable element in the story as is the possibility that the female survivor , or her children , hold the key to the cure of the virus is just wasted in favor of leaving the audience with a terrible , pessimistic and fatal ending ? Is that the bait for another sequel , parallel to the `` Alien '' series ? Meanwhile , we are left with a `` sequel '' that does not honor properly 28 Days Later , no matter the fact that Boyle is among the producers .
