The special effects were okay , but the story was weak , silly , and predictable.As a kid I loved the Alien movies . Aliens ( the 2nd one ) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mother caused M & M 's to rain down on the theater after an alien scared her . So , with that , I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories.What a disappointment . It was n't scary at all . People in the theater were actually ***SLEEPING*** . I was jealous of them . I was mostly glad that this was a short movie . Sadly , the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin.Do n't see this . If you are a big alien or predator fan and must catch it , wait for video or HBO .
