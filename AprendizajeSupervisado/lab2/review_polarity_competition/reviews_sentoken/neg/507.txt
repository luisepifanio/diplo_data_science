With such a talented cast and a semi-decent story , you think it would have been a great movie . Richard Gere plays a gynecologist in a large Texas town . His life is on the down side and he is close to having a nervous breakdown . His wife is going crazy . One of his daughters might be a lesbian and the other is just mean . He does n't know what to do . That 's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves to town and he is immediately infatuated with her . I love Robert Altman . He is a great story teller , but there was something missing from this film . If you truly love Altman , then take the time to watch it ... if you normally do n't , then you might want to steer clear from it .
