DARK DESCENT is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding . Filmed in Czechloslovakia , most of the actors and crew 's names end in `` v '' . Which would n't be so bad if they could at least ACT . Dean Cain , he of Superman fame , bullies his way through the mess , chewing his gum , and wincing after he gets shot in the leg . Scott Wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits , but the movie never says what happens to him . The movie starts off with Cain and Wiper ( sounds like a law firm , do n't it ? ) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant . Nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this , but Cain kills them all but one , a nasty guy who plans revenge . Meanwhile , many of the crew members are committing suicide , and Cain is investigating . ( Excited yet ? ) . Of course , it all culminates in a kind of underwater HIGH NOON when the bad guy who promised to come back , does so with two other goons , and chase Cain around the plant for a while . There is nothing exciting about any of this , as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal.Try THE ABYSS or GHOST SHIP or any other undersea film , and you 'll do much better than this waste of celluloid .
