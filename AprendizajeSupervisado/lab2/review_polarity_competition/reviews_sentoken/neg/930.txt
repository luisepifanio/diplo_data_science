I purchased Macgyver - The Complete Series . I supposedly purchased a new set sold by Amazon and not a third party . It came shrink wrapped , but many of the disks are scratched and have lots of skips . I can access most of the scenes by laboriously rewinding and fast forwarding to `` trick '' the scratches , but it is not the enjoyable `` Let 's watch all the episodes ! '' that I was paying for.MissyMacgyver - The Complete Series
