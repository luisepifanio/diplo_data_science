Interview with the Vampire [ Blu-ray ] I had a few extra dollars on an Amazon gift card and had n't seen this movie in some time . It fit the amount I had left to spend so I ordered it to add to my new Blu-Ray collection . While I enjoyed the movie as much as I remembered , the disc did not meet the high standards I 've come to expect from Blu-Ray . No popup menu , no real selection of features , and a video transfer that would be acceptable on a budget DVD , but not in 1080p . The intro by the director looks like a worn VHS tape . It 's certainly watchable , but I expected much better . I got a movie I wanted to enjoy again in pretty good picture instead of amazing Blu-Ray picture .
