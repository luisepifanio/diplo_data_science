I have to make this very clear : I can think of very few DVDs Madacy has produced that were good ( or even mediocre ) . This , however , is probably the worst I 've seen . The company has spat upon the great comedian 's grave . Several public domain shorts have been slapped on this DVD with terrible picture and sound that is downright disgraceful . In fact , this is the worst sound I 've even heard on a DVD . There are also the traditionally stinky Madacy extras ( Biography , Trivia , Quotes , Filmography ) .Do n't be fooled by the label at the back of the box ( & quot ; a must for collectors and fans of this comedy genius & quot ; ) . A very nice looking edition has been released by Criterion . Get it .
