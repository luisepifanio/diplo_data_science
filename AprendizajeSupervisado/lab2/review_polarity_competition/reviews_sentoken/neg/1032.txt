I have danced my whole life . Although I am not the quickest at picking up routines I found this impossible to follow . I practiced the first routine for days . You then have to find the actual routine by forwarding to it which is not easy to find.When she actually does the routine it is so fast it is impossible to follow . I tried for weeks and finally gave up . Many other reviews said the same thing but I thought my dance experience would make it easier for me . I was wrong . Her Mat DVD is really great.I also like Jillian Michaels dvd for cardio .
