I recently purchased a copy of the movie `` The Last Time I Saw Paris '' . It is one of my favorite films . As I watched the picture I noticed that the quality was very poor . White spots and reel scratches were prevelent throughout the film . It was evident that no work had been done to clean it up . I think it is terrible to treat such a great picture in this manner.It should not be sold to the public until work has been done to restore the picture to it 's original condition.a
