All right , you would think this is common knowledge , but apparently not as common as we had all realized . 'Starboard ' is right . 'Port ' is left . It is obvious from the direction the helmsman turns that the director , producers , cast , and crew of the movie are all a bunch of landlubbers that deserve to go down with the boat . This is not the only mistake in the movie , nor the most obvious . There are many other problems in this production that have already been discussed- the fact you know what 's going to happen before it starts , the crew shooting passengers , the length of the film , Leonardo DiCaprio- to name a few . While each are not overly distracting , taken in whole they make the movie somewhat disgusting to those who do n't like to read romance novels 24-7 . Even on that end , the romance is stupid ( for lack of my effort to find a better description ) . The only saving grace of the whole affair is the set , which is , quite simply , spectacular . They spared no expense building the ship replica , and it shows . Two stars for the sets , and nothing else .
