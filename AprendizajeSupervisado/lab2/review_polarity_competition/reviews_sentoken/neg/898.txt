This is not a review of the movie , but of the Bluray itself . If you 're into this new wave of Japanese splatter flicks then you know what to expect , and Tokyo Gore Police is amongst the best of its kind.However , Media Blasters has dropped the ball with this release . Or , rather , someone in their art department is just incredibly lazy . The back cover has been copied and pasted from their 2 disc DVD edition . This Bluray release is ONE disc , not two . Furthermore , the listed bonus material ( TGP short films , behind the scenes ) are not on the disc . What you do get is a trailer for the film and for other Tokyo Shock releases.The transfer is expectedly average ( these cheaply shot and quickly made features are never going to sparkle ) , and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks in both Japanese and English.It just boggles the mind that these kinds of oversights happen in this day and age . For shame , Media Blasters .
