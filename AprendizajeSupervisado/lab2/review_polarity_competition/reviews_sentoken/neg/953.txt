This edition is NOT better than the first ( single disc ) edition . Why would they do an `` Extra Extended '' edition and leave off the DTS sound ? The original ( single disc ) has DTS . Is n't that 's what DVD is all about , great sound as well as picture quality ? Do n't waste your money , if you already have the original copy ... keep it !
