Coleman Silk ( Anthony Hopkins ) is a highly respected college dean and professor . After one innocent remark is misinterpreted as a racist comment , he is forced to quit his job in disgrace . Coleman begins a strange affair with an aimless woman ( Nicole Kidman ) half his age , who has had a tragic past and is n't ready to return his love.For me , this strange little movie was doomed from the start , when the big finish is shown right away . The rest of the story is shown in choppy , anti-climactic flashbacks ( often out of order ) which did n't allow for any build-up in tension or sympathy for the main character , Coleman . As a young man from New Jersey , he 's played by Wentworth Miller who is quite charismatic and likeable , but looked and sounded nothing like the Welsh-accented adult Coleman ( who sometimes appeared to channel a leering Hannibal Lector ) . Hopkins is so horribly miscast in this role that it 's impossible to buy the racially-charged plot . Kidman was also completely wrong for this movie ; her innate grace and elegance could n't be hidden by a messy hairdo and I never bought her as an illiterate custodian . Her graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more creepy than romantic.There is so much personal tragedy among the main characters - including Gary Sinise who plays a troubled writer and Ed Harris as a crazed Vietnam vet - and yet the movie misfires completely and I felt no connection with them or the whole premise of injustice . Afterward , I was left shaking my head at this surprising mess of a movie and just amazed that so much talent could n't save it .
