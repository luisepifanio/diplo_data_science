I found , out of all I have bought of this series , this one to be of bad quality with it freezing and sticking and moving slowly . I had to send it back only to get a replacement that did similar altho not as bad , and I played it on two different DVD players & it started in the middle of the Disk . I felt it was opened before , as is had no stickers on the inside disk 's . I love the series and will keep it but was disappointed after all the others I have purchased . Other wise I have been happy about all the other products .
