This biopic , based on John Denver 's Take Me Home , An Autobiography , will be enjoyed by hardcore fans ( like me ) but is still awful in many ways . The story begins in the early 60s as John ( Chad Lowe ) begins his folk singing career . He meets Annie ( Kristin Davis ) at a gig and falls in love on the spot . They marry and move to Aspen , but as John 's career takes off , tension builds in the marriage . They divorce , he has a short second marriage , and he discovers his love of flying , something that finally earns his stern father 's ( Gerald McRaney ) respect.This movie is a Cliffs Notes summary of John 's life ; it 's poorly-written and amateurish and lacks any depth or emotion . Lowe ( who dons a hideous clown wig that makes him look like Dana Carvey in `` Waynes World '' ) mugs shamelessly throughout , playing a leering innocent who never seems to grow up . ( In fact , though the film covers thirty years , no one ages . ) Davis is very pretty but the horrible script does n't give her much chance to develop . McRaney plays the only character who seems real , and he 's the villain of the piece.The story is shallow and Lowe 's Denver is n't particularly likeable . His hair is so laughable and distracting that the movie does n't have a chance . Although we hear Denver sing many of his songs , Lowe is terrible at lip-syncing . The DVD extras are worthless ; where 's some footage of the real JD we loved ?
