I actually just finnished watching the movie and wanted to see if others disliked the movie.The book was by far a lot better than the movie . There was so much left out in the movie . The acting was sub-par ... and by that I mean I did n't seem to care what happened next to each of the characters . It did n't grasp a hold of my attention like the book did . I had high expectations for the movie ( the book was great ... how could the movie not be ) , but was thoroughly disapointed . I gave it a two stara because just because it did stay partially true to the book ( except for everything it left out ) which is a rarity in movies based on books these days.As for the wonderful controversy behind the book ... as long as everyone else likes arguing , I guess it 's appropriate to throw in my two cents.My opinion is , is ... WHY DOES EVERYONE TAKE THIS STORY SO SERIOUSLY ? ? ? ? Thats all it is ... a story . Do people fail to comprehend that this is a fiction novel ? Brown never claims this to be a completly true story . He presents facts throughout the book , but mixes them in with fiction for one purpose ... to make an interesting book that will sell.This movie/book was a good fictional story ... it had an interesting plot , and it made a lot of money.Well , I 'll stop preaching now and leave you with my advice ... read the book if you want to get yourself wrapped up in a very interesting FICTIONAL story . If you have a few hours to kill ( and do n't like reading ) and have absoloutly nothing better to do , take a nap ( do n't waste your time with the movie ... read the book ) . And please , if the plot offends you in any way , read the book anyways , just do n't take it to heart .
