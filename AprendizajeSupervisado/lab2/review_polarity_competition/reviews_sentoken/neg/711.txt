Season three had new directors , and new writers . Only one episode was written by a returning writer.This seems to have completely changed the tone of the show . Seasons one and two are science fiction , season three seems to bear more resemblance to Gilligan 's Island or Lost in Space.The approach seems to be to throw in whatever fantastic characters the writers could think of , regardless of how stupid or out of place.The third season features Medusa , a Caveman , The Flying Dutchman , The Abominable Snowman , a fire-breathing dinosaur , a two headed dinosaur and a beetle whose bite makes you evil ! Logic , continuity and characterization all go out the window . Sleestak and Chaka talk , Enik does stupid things in the name of 'logic ' . The only thing better in this season is the acting.The only reason to watch this season is if you want to see all the the episodes for completeness . If you liked the first two seasons , you probably wo n't like this .
