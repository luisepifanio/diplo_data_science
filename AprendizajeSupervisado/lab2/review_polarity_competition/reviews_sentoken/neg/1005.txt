I 'm generally a supporter of Tyler Perry productions . That being , the plays , and the TV shows . The movies for some reason never do it for me . Why Did I Get Married was not bad . The sequel for me , failed miserably . For one the intense comic relief along with the supercharged drama does n't blend well for me ( i.e . Madea Goes to Jail - the movie ) The plot was all too predictable , ex wants the ex back , hubby and wife are n't happy , they argue and tragically one dies..meehhhh ... . oh , let 's not mention , one has cancer and it 's not addressed at all other than when it 's mentioned..It just seemed like a mash up of a bunch of recycled movie plots , all put together crudely . Hmm , just did n't sit well with me at all . Sorry .
