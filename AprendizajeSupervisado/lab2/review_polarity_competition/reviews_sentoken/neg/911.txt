Like the other reviews have stated , its repetitive . A couple knockouts taken from the ultimate series 1-3 and then they decided to throw in about 20 minutes of garbage stoppages . if your going to have a dvd that is the ultimate ultimate knockouts , you at least better have the silva/belfort knockout . the last 15 minutes is fights that arent even knockouts ; they are long , drawn out stoppages by low level fighters . Dont buy this dvd if your looking for something new in the series or if you think its a greatest hits compilation cuz its not .
