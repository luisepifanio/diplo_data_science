As a fan of the Hellsing series I can not honestly say this series is worth watching . There is no real reason to watch this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly the superior work . While Alucard is badass if you watch the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs and compare them to the manga of the series you will see that the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs are perfectly animated version of the manga . So do n't waste your money on the impure souls series as one it has nothing to do with the manga and two its not even finished . Hellsing Ultimate is the only true way to enjoy Hellsing animated .
