I have read a lot of the reviews from other customers that bought this movie and can only figure that they must be so overcome by story and great cast of this great epic that they failed to see the poor quailty of the viedo . I had been waiting a good long time for this movie to come out on dvd and the transfer quality of the video is so poor that its a bitter pill to sollow . I understand that it is a movie that was made for television but that is no excuse for what they have done to great film ! I sure wish I had rented this movie before I bought it and would highly recommend to anyone interested that they do just that before they make the purschase !
