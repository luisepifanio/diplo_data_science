The third installment of the popular & quot ; Beverly Hills Cop & quot ; series is like a distant relative who comes to stay with you . At first , you 're glad to see them and catch up on old times , but they sure wear out their welcome fast . This film reaches that point after about fifteen minutes.Eddie Murphy is back as Alex Foley , the increasingly improbable fish-out-of-water detective from Detroit . Once again , Axel is doing battle with the law enforcement establishment , the Beverly Hills Police Department , and the Bad Guys who killed his friend . Sound familiar ? Even Serge ( Bronson Pinchot ) is back , in a desperate , painful scene that seems to go on forever.The direction , by veteran Murphy helmer John Landis , is acceptable , showing Landis ' usual flair for pacing and stunts . The screenplay by the usually reliable Steven deSouza , though , is woefully half-baked . It is never clear what the tone of the picture is supposed to be . The action scenes are very off-hand and frequently played for laughs , while the comedy scenes are forced and unfunny . The story never builds the sense of jeopardy and conflict that is essential to a film of this type . It is neither a laugh riot , nor is it even remotely suspenseful . Also , any film that makes Hector Elizondo -- one of the best character actors around -- look bad has some serious problems.There are two good things about & quot ; Cop III. & quot ; One is an excellent action sequence set on an amusement park Ferris wheel . That is the only exciting part of the film . The other thing I liked was the series of cameos by a variety of famous film directors ( like George Lucas ) , a typical Landis gag . It at least gives you something to look for in some pretty boring scenes .
