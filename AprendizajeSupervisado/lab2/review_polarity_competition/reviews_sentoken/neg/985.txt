This movie was not meant to be taken seriously ... .I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80 's action flick experience . If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive , take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up , and can be shot at 100 's of times and not take a hit . The dialouge is silly , however , the acting is pretty good . Sit back and enjoy/laugh .
