I really hoped MLB & A & E had learned from the 2004 experience that fans want the complete set of games , including the ALDS games . Instead , they give us a more incomplete product ! This set does not include games 1 through 4 of the ALDS . We miss out on the first game - a Beckett gem . And the excitement of games 2 - 4 , when Cleveland proved they were true contenders ! And while the 2004 set lacked the 3 ALDS games against the Angels , at least it was produced in HD . This World Series set was rushed to market , so much so that it is not in HD or widescreen , which are practically automatic on all DVDs today.So while I appreciate MLB 's effort to get a product out in time for the holidays , I truly wish they had postponed the offer until such time the entire postseason series of games could be made available in 1 set - with all the viewing perks !
