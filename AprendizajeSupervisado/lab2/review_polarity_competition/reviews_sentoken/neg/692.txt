This dvd features 3 episodes of the documentary series America At War : The Home Front that aired on PBS pesumably in the '90s as Eric Sevareid , the narrator , passed away in 1992 . Only the first episode , `` A String of Pearls '' , is about the `` Rosie the Riveter '' phenomenon of women taking over men 's jobs while the men were at war . The other 2 episodes cover other aspects of the war & its effects on the warfront and have nothing to do with `` Rosie '' . If you want a more comprehensive look at `` Rosie '' , keep looking .
