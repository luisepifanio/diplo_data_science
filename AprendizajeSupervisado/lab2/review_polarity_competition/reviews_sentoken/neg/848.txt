The DVD is unwatchable . The picture for all the movies is so washed out you ca n't even tell what you are watching . The sound is only marginally better . A complete waste of money even at only 11 dollars . I threw mine out after trying to sit through 3 of the movies . All the movies look and sound as bad as any I have ever seen on a DVD .
