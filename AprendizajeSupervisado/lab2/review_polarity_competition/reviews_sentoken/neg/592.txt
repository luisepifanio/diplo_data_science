I wanted so badly to enjoy this film . I kept hoping that somehow it would 'pick up ' and get on its feet . Unfortunately it never did , and in fact just kind of gave way to a bizarre nothingness somewhere in the middle . Basically this is about a cynical paranormal writer staying in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happened over the years . And really ? That 's about it.Yet , there was so much to work with in the story . It could have been deeper , the plot more involved . The characters could have been so much more than they were . This film is a hodge-podge of mostly nebulous loose ends that never get tied up . It moves at a snails pace and you wait for something that just never happens . The ending is unbelievable and contrived . However , the special effects are very good .
