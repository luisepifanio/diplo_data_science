The sound is terrible ! I love the music and I 've worn out both of their CDs but the poor sound on this DVD has no power at all . Sully is almost inaudible . Godsmack ought to be embarrassed by this release . I ca n't even watch the whole thing because the poor sound is such a distraction . For those that say that this is true concert sound , I submit that a concert DVD out to sound like the first row not the last row . Save your money ... it 's not worth half the price .
