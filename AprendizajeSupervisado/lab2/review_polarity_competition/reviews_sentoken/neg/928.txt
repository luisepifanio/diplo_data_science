I bought this because I 'm a big cowboys fan , and I thought it would be fun to learn some of the DCC routines . I read the other customers ' somewhat negative reviews , but I 'm not in the best shape , so I thought it would be okay for me.WRONG ! First off , the DVD is SHORT , around 45 minutes from start to finish . You only get one dance routine , which is broken up into four parts . I was expecting some fun dance music ( similar to what the cheerleaders perform to ) , and it was a lame techno-type track throughout . I also found some of the girls ' voices to be particularly annoying.I did n't feel energized or like I burned any calories.All in all , this product was a big disappointment for me .
