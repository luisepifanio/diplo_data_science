I would n't go as far as the previous reviewer in saying that it 's some kind of liberal conspiracy movie ( and if it is , I 'd hate to hear what people say about movies like Ferngully and Once Upon A Forest ) . I doubt that the fact most Humans care little for our impact on the environment is a newsflash to anyone , nor is the fact that some of us kill other living creatures for a mirad of reasons ranging from amusement to actual neccessity . That being said , however , I ca n't give this movie a better rating . The CG animation is of a *far* lower quality than the cover makes it appear ( more in line with a Saturday morning cartoon than an actual feature-length movie ) . I do n't think I found a single joke in the whole movie funny , and more than a few scenes were so gross I preferred to look away rather than watch them . The imagery is often dark and desturbing ( the woman trying to decapitate a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind ) , and the peaceful outdoor scenes look very fakey . The animation has several parts that are noticibly poor when compared to a good ( or even decent ) CG movie . Also , the Humans are distorted almost beyond recognition . In short , there are a lot of good CG titles out there , but this certainly is n't one of them .
