I can not say enough how bad this movie is . The only reason it got one star was the Amazon does n't have zero stars . his is just a bad movie . It 's not even a good bad movie , nor is it fun to watch . The underlying premiss is interesting , in a six-grade sort of way , and from it one would expect an Indian Jones style , two-fisted adventure . Two worlds exist , one good , one evil . An ancient civilization once opened the gate between these two worlds before , and was wiped out . Now , the key has been shattered ( why not destroyed ? They never destroy these things ! ) and sent to the four corners of the earth . Now , take everything that 's ever been neat , exciting , fun , and interesting from an Indiana Jones-style movie and flush it down the toile ta few times . Plunge it out , and slap it on some film with some inept acting and inaine pacing . Set that on fire and there you go , Alone in the Dark . What a waste .
