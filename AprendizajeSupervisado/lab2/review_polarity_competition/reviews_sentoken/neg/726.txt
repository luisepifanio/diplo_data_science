I rented `` 28 Days '' with no expectations , and was impressed . Good action , suspenseful and plot . 28 weeks , however , does not live up as a sequel . If the entire movie was like the first 15 minuets , I would have given it 5 stars , but a lackluster plot after this point almost put me to sleep . The subway scene was so contrived and predictable that I ws tempted to fast foreword through it.No real terror , no character development , and just the same mind numbing packs of zombies chasing these idiots around London makes this one the biggest sequel flops to what could have been an A+ movie .
