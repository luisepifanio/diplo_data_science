We spend half our time on Lake Como so thought this DVD would be great to have . I wish the other reviews had been available before we bought the DVD . They hit many of the points -- this is at best amateurish raw video from a hand-held camcorder . It is completely incoherent , has no continuity and is an embarrassment . Does n't Amazon review personal DVDs before they make them available ?
