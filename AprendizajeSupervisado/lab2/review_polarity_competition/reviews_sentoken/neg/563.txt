This film has always been one of my favorites.I own three copies on VHS ( two back-ups just incase the one I usually watch wears out ) . I make all ofmy friends watch it , and most of them love it as much as I do.It 's stupid , completely inept , and totally hilarious . I put it up there with Richard Elfman 's `` Forbidden Zone '' and John Paiz 's `` Crimewave '' ( A.K.A . `` The Big Crimewave '' ) as one of the three greatest cult movies of all time.Only problem is nobody has ever heard of this movie . So I could n't believe my luck when I stumbled upon the DVD ! ! ! I thought I was dreaming . I was tempted to buy three copies ... just in case.First off , I watched the deleted scenes and extras , which were pretty great . It seemed odd , though , becauseI had already seen many of the deleted scenes ( they are part of my VHS versions ) . Then , when I settled in to watch the movie , my heart was broken.Somebody , in their infinite wisdom , decided tocensor out almost all of the nudity , and many otherscenes have either been shortened , or are missing entirely.I suppose this version of the film might seem a little morecompetent , because the missing scenes may have slowed down the pacing of the movie a little , but themissing scenes were all PRICELESS . The ineptitude of thisfilm is what made it special , and editing it down to amore `` professional-feeling '' version is borderline blasphemy.After seeing this edited and censored version , I wished I had never bought it at all . I wish it did n't even exist . Thank god for my VHS copies.Whoever decided to censor and edit this film should beashamed of themselves . Thanks a lot for wrecking one of my favorite films . I only give it two stars becausesome of the extras are cool .
