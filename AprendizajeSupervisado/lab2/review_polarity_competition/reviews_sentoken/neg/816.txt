I was really disappointed when I saw that what I got in the mail was a knockoff DVD for the regular price ( by A2ZCOS instead of a studio ) . What I expected came to pass . This is the only DVD that my player has ever been unable to read . First , a message came up from A2ZCOS saying that the movie was old and the sound quality might be lower than expected . Then the DVD player stalled and said that the DVD was `` dirty '' and was unable to read it . I really do n't expect Amazon to be selling this junk , but I guess I have to double check from now on . As for the movie , it is one of the great films of all time . -- -- - I really consider that Amazon owes me for the wasted order , but whatever .
