As a lifelong fan of this program , I was sorely disappointed to find that Sony did not actually `` restore '' the film as claimed . The film print used for the video transfer is scratched and filled with specs , `` fuzz '' etc . As many other reviewers have noted , the soundrack is nothing to write home about , either . Truly , you are better off getting an old used VHS version of the program , as the `` bonus '' features of this DVD re-release are insignificant ( no `` making of '' features , interviews , or anything like that ) .Surely a program this beloved deserves an actual restoration using the original source materials ( if they exist ) for both film and soundtrack .
