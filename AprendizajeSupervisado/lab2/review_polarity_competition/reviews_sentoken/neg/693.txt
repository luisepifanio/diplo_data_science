I bought this not noticing this was the `` director 's son 's edit '' . I hope the director 's son never edits another movie again ! The edit was something a high-school child could have done on his i-mac . Scenes that were once complete now end abruptly and jump around , mouths move with no dialouge , horrible growls were added to fight scenes . . . the list goes on . I plan to sell this back and wait for the original cut to be released in the US .
