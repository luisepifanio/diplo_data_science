This movie is horrible ! ! ! What a waste of money and of my time . First off the previews made it appear as if it was about a man looking for a `` Proverbs 31:30 '' woman and it was nothing of the sort ! Then they use Christian Keyes who was a actor in many of Tyler Perry plays so I immediate thought this was a Christian friendly movie . A movie based on nothing but LUST ! Dont waste your money . 0 out of 5 popcorn bags for me . SMH
