It would be difficult to formulate a coherent film composed of the disparate elements that the director and others obviously felt obliged to include within this scenario , but a worthy attempt is made , only falling apart after the first half . A Pre-Columbian ceremonial disc , golden and bejewelled , has been split asunder , and while one half is displayed in a New York City museum 's permanent collection , the other segment has become the subject of a search expedition to an Andean region , under the aegis of American archaeologist Brooks Willings ( David Keith ) , who is obsessed with bringing about its recovery . His wife and daughter have remained in New York but when young Diana ( Camilla Belle ) has become a disciplinary problem in her school , the two join Brooks in the Andean village where his expedition is based , his wife hoping to correct Diana 's behavioural distress , only to be burdened by additional plights originating from their new situation . Continuity falters at this point as Diana becomes enmeshed in village mystic rites , Brooks and his wife ( played ably by Nancy Allen ) fall into serious marital discord , a Catholic priest , portrayed with humour by John Rhys-Davies is tormented by local cultists , the expedition has developed personnel and funding shortages , et alia , - too many threads to be woven into an accomplished storyline . To solve its many self-imposed conundra , the work lapses into inane fantasy , including silly special effects , as a facile resolution . Keith is wooden , manifestly uninspired by his role , but Belle is effective and the timing of Rhys-Davies is deserving of study , while acting laurels go to the superb East Indian Roshan Seth , who easily dominates each of his scenes in the part of a shaman with extraordinary wisdom and magical powers . Shot in northern Argentina 's scenic province of Salta , the picture benefits from both the cinematography of Maximo Munzi and the faithfully ethnic scoring of Luis Bacalov ; if only a way had been seen to strengthen the stuttering scenario .
