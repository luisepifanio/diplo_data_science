The good news about this DVD is that it does focus more on Big Brother as a band , rather than exclusively on Janis Joplin , as other documentaries have . Unfortunately , the sound quality is overall very poor , and the images are often washed out . This is especially noticeable because much of the same footage has been used in such other films as JANIS , MONTEREY POP , BIG BROTHER : BALL AND CHAIN , and various TV specials ( A & E , Biography , VH1 and so on ) so comparisons are too easy to make . I have reissues of 78 rpm vinyl records on CD that have been digitally restored to offer clearer sound than this DVD , and have seen silent movie images similarly restored , so I can only surmise that this documentary was hastily thrown together with an eye to the fast buck and not much concern for production quality . That being said , the DVD does offer a fascinating look at the band members then and now . Some of them look back on the Psychedelic Era with nostalgic fondness , while others have obviously been clinging to and rehearsing their grudges for the last 40 years . If they 'd never met Janis Joplin , Big Brother 's story might have been very different -- whether nobody would ever have heard of them , or whether they 'd have made it big on their own raw-edged , bluesy terms , we 'll never know . But this DVD offers tantalizing glimpses of not only what was , but what might have been .
