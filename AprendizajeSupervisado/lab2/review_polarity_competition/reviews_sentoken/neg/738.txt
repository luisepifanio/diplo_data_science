For the first time in my life , I wish I had a VHS copy even with the DVD released . I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie , and there is no vortex sound effect . Then the entire scene in Lake Town is ... muted . The arrows are silenced , the dragon roars as a mouse , and the fire , it crackles as a loud annoyance . I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing , now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD . I will be buying the VHS shortly .
