Purchased this DVD and discovered it had horrible skipping problems . After taking it back , Suncoast exchanged it for another copy which had the same problem . This disk will not play on the Toshiba SD-3109 dual tray player . The movie tells the story of a British engineering unit that gets surrounded by a Zulu army in Africa . Zulu is very accurate historically going so far as to show the need for the Zulu to close with short spears . With its fine acting it definitely is one of the better war movies available . I would suggest the reader to tape this one from the History channel or buy it on VHS .
