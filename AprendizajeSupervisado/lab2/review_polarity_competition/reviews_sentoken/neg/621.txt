This Tracy Anderson Method Dance Cardio Workout DVD was horrible , something that a cheerleader could have put together and just as annoying . There is nothing fun about it and the music is awful . Beware when ordering it right from the company website . You are stuck with anything you buy once you open it , and of course that is not posted anywhere to warn you .
