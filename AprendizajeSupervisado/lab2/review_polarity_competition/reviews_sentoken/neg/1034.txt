Having grown up with the original of the Thunderbirds on TV ( even on B & W ) , I was hoping for something better . I suppose that as I 'm getting on a bit , pubescent teenage angst no longer appeals very much . I wanted to see the machines , the drama , the tension of people coping with disasters that took them beyond themselves , the triumph of decent people over nature 's impersonal malevolence , and all that good stuff that the original had in abundance , along with a campiness and humor that did n't take itself too seriously . The original was about the adventure first , with the 'romance ' incidental , and that 's an important point , rather lost in this film.This is a teenage 'growing-up ' movie that uses the Thunderbirds as a cover . It really did n't need the Thunderbirds part , except for the sets . The plot is otherwise perfectly ordinary and can be seen anywhere . The degree of improbability involved is far greater than the originals and a bit hard to stomach . The acting leaves a lot to be desired , and yes , the 1960s puppets often were a lot more lifelike than the actors in this film , and Ben Kingsley does n't really come across as evil , or even bad-tempered.So , if you want a teenage movie like so many others , this is for you . If you want something like the original , do n't bother with this film . Wait until someone has the guts to produce a 'grown-up ' film ( rated 'G ' ) in the classic genre . Unfortunately , this is not a particularly memorable film .
