A fantasy-prone geeky kid ( so geeky that the other members of his role-playing group taunt him ) dies and a BLACK KNIGHT rises up to avenge him . Kind of ho-hum in that there is no nudity ( that 's actually okay given the cast ) , the violence is on par with a made-for-TV movie , and the plot is pretty predictable . I liked the effort that they put into it to make RPGs seem sinister and sexy .
