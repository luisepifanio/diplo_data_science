This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre . That is not to say that it would n't make a good rental ; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person , but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie . WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle . Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick , this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life .
