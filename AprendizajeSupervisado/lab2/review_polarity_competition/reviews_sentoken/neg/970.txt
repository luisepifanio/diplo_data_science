First off . This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD , so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players.That being said , this is DVD rip of a VHS master . It 's ok , it 's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun . Not very good in the details . No chapter stops . I believe it 's only 30 minutes long.I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD .
