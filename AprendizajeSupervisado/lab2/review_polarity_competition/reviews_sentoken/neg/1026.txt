`` Alias '' is one of my favorite shows - even in its weakest it was excellent compared to nearly every other show on broadcast television . The fifth season , while reinventing the show again , is highly entertaining , exciting , and thrilling , and I recommend that anyone watch it.However , I have serious , serious problems with this DVD release . I do not actually own it , because I bought the far superior Rambaldi box complete collection ( all five Alias seasons in one ) . But I have seen the season five release and it 's terrible . Out of all five DVD releases , it is the ugliest box . The promo picture is horrible , the green cover does n't go well at all with the other seasons , and the big words `` FINAL SEASON '' is simply tacky . The box is nowehere in size to the other releases either , it 's what feels like less than half an inch thick . This has been a major problem for me as well , with Alias - Buena Vista changes the packaging for each season . It 's very annoying.Also , the special features are nothing . A few interesting features , but overall the supplements are very weak for the final season . The entire thing feels rushed and botched , like no one CARED that this was the last season of such a beloved series.If you can afford it , I highly urge you to invest in the complete collection . It 's very well done and put together ( although it DOES have it 's flaws ) and has a bonus disc of extras that are very informative and fun to watch . However , only 40,000 are being made so supplies are limited .
