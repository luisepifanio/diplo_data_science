This movie is a TOTAL JOKE ! You would think by looking at the poster that it 's action-packed and stunning like `` underworld '' or `` Resident Evil '' . NOT ! ! The actors were super slow with the fighting scenes ( like they 're practicing ) and the dialogues were stupid . Waste of talent for Ben Kingsley ( who is always good as we all know ) . You ca n't tell if the setting is in England or the US because the actors ca n't decide with their accents . Waste of money and time..
