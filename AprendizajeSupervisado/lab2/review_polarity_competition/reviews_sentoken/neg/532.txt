Finally I gave into al the hype and actually went to watch Minority Report . The question I 'm left with now that I have seen it is : what was all the hype about ? Although I have to admit that some of the computer generated special effects were impressive the acting lacked any kind of substance.However , what annoyed me the most was the incredible amount of product placement throughout the movie . Was n't Mr. Spielberg sure if he would make enough money at the box office that he had to advertise Aquafina , Pepsi , Gap , Lexus , and Nokia throughout the movie ? Overall I spent two and a half hours in the movie during which I asked myself more than once if all the people that walked around in the movie theater during the showing of the movie , just as bored as I was ? The bottom line is , good special effects for free and a few interesting scenes like the chase in the car factory , other than that I can watch commercials at home on my TV for free .
