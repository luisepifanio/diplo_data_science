As I was born and bred in the UK I have fond memories of growing up to the various Carry-On films . Now I reside in the USA I decided to do a search to see if any Carry-On films were available in NTSC format , and to my joy I found this movie . Joy turned to disgust when I actually sat down and watched it - the conversion process from PAL to NTSC looks like it has been performed in somebody 's garden shed on second hand video editing equipment . The picture is fuzzy and the soundtrack hisses like a ruptured high=pressure steam pipe . This is a great movie , but the quality of the tape means that it is nearly unwatchable . Until someone decides to remaster these films onto DVD I will not buy another one .
