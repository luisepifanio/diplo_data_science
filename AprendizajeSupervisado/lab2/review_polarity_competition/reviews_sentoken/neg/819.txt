What happened to that talented and original director who took quirky subject matter and made it brilliant ? Who is this imposter making nothing but half-baked remakes of perfectly good movies ? A pod person ? If you want to see Solaris , a very good film of it was made in the Soviet Union back in the 70 's . It was mysterious and tragic and , at the same time , hopeful.All qualities the 2002 version lacks . Characters are merged . Families obliterated.George Cloony may be a pretty face , but any demanding character is beyond him . Solaris is far to subtle a project for him . He needs much more obvious formulaic roles to really shine .
