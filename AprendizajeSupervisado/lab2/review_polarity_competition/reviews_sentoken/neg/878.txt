This movie was an extremely poor attempt to chronicle the life of one of the world 's foremost environmental/humanitarian educators of our time . John used his celebrity to further his beliefs and his passions and through his many admirers , those visions are being continued today . The inaccuracies are far to numerous to mention as well as mundane portrayal by Chad Lowe.If you want to see the REAL John Denver , I suggest you purchase `` Let This Be A Voice '' and/or `` John Denver : A Song 's Best Friend .
