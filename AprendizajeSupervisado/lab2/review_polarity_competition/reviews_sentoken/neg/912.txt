This movie is excellent and deserves five stars but this release on DVD has the same problem as the first release , and because I 've bought both from this studio I feel I have a right to complain . This is a long movie and Columbia has twice now saw fit to place the first half up the Intermission on one side and the second half on the other side . Flipping a disc is something I have n't had to do since LP 's vanished .
