I just finished watching this movie . It is slow , yes , but it also lacks any REAL plot line , PERIOD . The actors lack skill except for the lead Jasmine who may have potential with time . The scenes did not connect and were extremely choppy . It is my strong opinion that the other reviews MUST be connected to the producer/writer/actors in order to give any kind of positive review . This movie is truly sacrilegious , blasphemous , and disrespectful to the Church and God . I am not a `` holy roller '' but feel that there should be some things that are respected and not mocked . If they were trying to convey a concept , it was VERY poorly done .
