If I would have read C. Leonard 's review , I would have known to pass on thisseries . Monkeys Go Home ruined this for me too . I gave it as a gift and wasamazed to receive a call telling me that Monkeys Go Home was in the MightyDucks 3 movie case . Well , must be an accident , right ? ! ? I sent the first set back and just received the replacement complete with the Monkeys Go Home movie in the third case ! ! ! ! Save your money folks ... .this is not the place to buy a boxed set of MightyDuck movies ! !
