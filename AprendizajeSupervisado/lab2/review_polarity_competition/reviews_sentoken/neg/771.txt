The Last Unicorn is one of my favorite animated films of all time and I have waited years for this movie to be released on DVD . The soundtrack is wonderful too , and I listen to it often . You can imagine how excited I was when I got the Amazon notification that it would finally be available , so the movie itself gets 5 stars but this edition gets 1 star and deserves nothing more . This has to be the absolute worse picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD ... heck the VHS copy has to be better than this . The sound quality is terrible too , sounding almost like a record , and there are absolutely no extras . Not to mention that the movie was only released in full screen , but I could have dealt with that had the rest of the DVD been done right . Artisan/FHE did such a shoddy job with this DVD that I will be very careful when picking up anything else from them in the future . I tried to return my copy , but of course since the seal was broken , they could do nothing about it so I resold it online and have ordered a no region copy of the German release , which looks and sounds great ! I recommend anyone wanting this movie to consider that for themselves . Maybe Artisan/FHE will take the hint and actually give us some credit by releasing a version of The Last Unicorn worth paying for .
