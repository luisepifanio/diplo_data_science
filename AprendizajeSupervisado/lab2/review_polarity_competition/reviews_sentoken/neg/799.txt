I watched Megaforce last night and there is a definite sound issue . The film has n't been sped up , the frame rate looks fine but all the sounds , music , voices , etc ... sound like they have been pitched up or something . I 've had an old VHS copy for many years and would catch it every once and a while when it was broadcast on cable back in the day . As soon as the opening narration started I could tell there was an issue . Hopefully Henstooth video is looking into this and will offer a disc swap . Other that this cheese-fest 80 's guilty pleasure has never looked better . They did a great job on that , just need to fix this audio problem . Ace Hunter is n't supposed to sound like Alvin .
