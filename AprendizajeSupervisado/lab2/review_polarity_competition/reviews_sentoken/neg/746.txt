It 's been said many times already , but another 2 cents ' worth : wonderful acting , mediocre story . The casting and acting are both flawless , and the chemistry between the two talented leads is wonderful , but I still found watching it to be somewhat empty and depressing . The film is , in essence , a couple of hours spent with a dysfunctional family , and there 's not nearly enough insight or redemption on the whole to make it a worthwhile visit .
