Can I begin by saying I love aerobics and dance videos . I wish I could say that this was a good purchase , but immediately after putting it on , I regretted it and wanted a refund . It was expensive and I would n't have minded that so much if it were do-able . If you are looking for a DVD that you can just put in and start sweating to , this is definitely not the product for you . However , if you have a lot of spare time to learn many choreography moves prior to the actual work out ( or are just taking a break from your MTV back-up dancer gig ) , then definitely order this one .
