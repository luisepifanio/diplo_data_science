I first pre-ordered this item during the summer , and was very happy when it arrived weeks before the December 23rd shipping estimate . Yet when I opened the box , I was disappointed to see that they had used cardboard sleeves to keep the DVDs in . Even worse , they had a rough cardboard edge directly in the middle of the DVD.Due to the packaging , the DVDs shifted around during shipping , and several were scratched . Approximately 5 would start freezing while being played - but not until a good part of an episode ! I contacted Amazon , who sent me another box , and allowed me to pick and choose between the better DVDs . I managed to get a complete set that works , with minor scratches , but I 'm afraid that storing them inside the Rambaldi DVD sleeves will just scratch them further.Great idea , but the packaging is horrible . You 'll spend more time trying to assemble a working set , then it 's worth .
