It takes only a few minutes to see how awful this thing is . The film starts out with some jets involved in a high-speed , transcontinental race . Well , our hero pilot Grant ( Antonio Sabato Jr. ) decides that he needs to be refueled.Have you ever seen a pit crew refuel a car out on the track during a NASCAR race ? Nope ... neither have I . It would be kinda dangerous I imagine . Well , Grant 's jet gets refueled by another plane while they are in the direct flight path of the other racing jets . What happens ? Duh ... there is a horrible collision and three pilots ( along with 11 spectators ... huh ? ) end up dead . Nice move guys.Perhaps the funniest , and most pathetic , event in the film happens a bit later . Several years have passed since the tragic jet race incident and we are listening to an executive of the network which had done a live broadcast of the race . The executive says ... are you ready ? ... he says that the footage of the jets colliding during the race was the highest rated piece of news footage that they had shown during the past four years . Unbelievable ! ! Talk about a future world in which nothing exciting happens . Must be boring.Other things to look for are a guy who is somehow making a coughing noise while his mouth is n't even moving . Also , a scene where a shirtless Sabato Jr. is about to put on a tank top . He picks it up but the camera changes angles and now it 's nowhere to be seen . Then the camera changes angles again and he 's pulling it over his head . Great editing ! Everything is bargain basement in this film except for the halfway decent acting . With a paper thin plot and awful effects , though , I strongly recommend not wasting your time watching this dreck . A final note ... with no nudity and no graphic violence , I have no clue as to why this is rated R .
