After their son is implicated in the murder of his girlfriend , parents Streep and Neeson disagree on what course of action to take . Should son Furlong tell the truth as advocated by Streep or should he go with Neeson , who has already destroyed evidence on his behalf , and make up a new version of events in an effort to remain out of jail.The tagline of how far would you go to protect your own flesh and blood promises an awful lot more than it delivers . Indeed , it never manages to raise tension , even in scenes that by rights should be the most interesting in the movie , such as the revelation of what really happened between Furlong and his girlfriend . All performances are intact and correct ; this is exactly the kind of role that fits Streep best ( even though she was a whole lot more enjoyable in 'The River Wild ' ) , Neeson is likewise very good in an unfortunately stereotypical role and even though Furlong is often typecast as the troubled teen he plays it better than any other.However , the primary flaw is that something that promises emotion never really reaches boiling point and despite the star names you ca n't help but think that it all looks very much like a TV movie . All this and the ending offers no kind of conclusion or redemption for its character , leaving its audience hanging but not really caring .
