Gosh and gee , IS she playing twins again ? We did n't need a remake of The Parent Trap , and we need this even less . I did n't care if the guy tortured one -- or both , if that 's the case -- of the girls because Lohan is so burnt out at this point that it 's nauseating . Her personal , off-camera image aside , she was lousy in this movie , but the movie stunk as well . What were they smoking to put this debacle out in the theaters ? Hmm , seems like a bad trip ... Lohan has that squeaky , husky brat voice that gets on your nerves , just like her near-cousin Miley Cyrus , and it gets on your last nerve very quickly , just like a squeaky doorknob . You have no idea what 's going on at first , and then it plays out even worse than the most horrific offering Lifetime has given us through the years.Terrible casting and lousy dialogue are all power driven by a stupid title that does n't ring true . Too bad it did n't drive straight over a cliff . Add to the fact that we have the irritating Julia Ormond `` playing '' a mother who just happens to let her daughter go upstairs with a boyfriend and boink his brains out very loudly . Oh , yeah ? I do n't care who you think you are ; amnesia -- or whatever it is -- would n't be enough for me to let my kids indulge in carnal pleasures under my roof . You do n't like any of these characters and you do n't feel sorry for them . That 's the key to a great movie in ANY genre -- feeling compassion , or at least empathy -- for at least two people in a feature . There 's none of that here , and we are treated to tons of bloody scenes that do n't even come off with the intended effect . When you get down to it , the best actors in IKWKM were the blue rose petals . In short , two hours were dismembered from my life that I 'll never get back .
