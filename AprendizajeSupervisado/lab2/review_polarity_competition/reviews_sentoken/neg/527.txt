This weird little filmic exercise by ultra low budget schlockmeister Bill Zebub owes much of its ' inspiration , I would imagine , to the ( vastly superior ) puppet epic `` Team America '' by the South Park crew . Following a lengthy comedic 'disclaimer ' at the outset of the flick the 'plot ' essentially attempts to parody many mainstream Hollywood-isms , politics & religion , and to inject as many disturbing images of sexually mutilated Barbi dolls as possible . The 'actiing ' is provided by a variety of 'action figure ' toys that are manipulated ( clunkily ) by hand and via green screen superimpositions . A 'little of this ' is amusing , but ultimately the concept runs out of gas and Zebub 's ghoulish pre-occupation with the vilolent S & M imagery perpetuated on female dolls gets kind of creepy . Still , there is some cleverness in the base concept which makes this satirical flik more engaging than many of Zebub 's ostensibly more 'serious ' efforts . I would recommend only buying this ( if at all ) at a minimal discounted ( used ) price as the content would n't likely stand up to multiple viewings .
