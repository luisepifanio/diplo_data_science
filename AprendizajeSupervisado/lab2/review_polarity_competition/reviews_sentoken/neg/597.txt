I honestly do n't know what Artisan were thinking by releasing this in pan and scan with terrible Dolby 2.0 sound that desperately needs remastering . The cropped 1.33:1 picture is grainy and has quite a lot of speckles and dirt thru-out . This really is Dolph 's best movie and Segal makes for a seriously cool villain but with this pathetic treatment by Artisan all the cool gun battles and car chases and explosions are just as rubbish as they were on VHS . Pick it up if the price temps but do n't expect much .
