The Last Unicorn may be my favorite movie to date and I was so excited to hear that it was finally announced in the US . Finally I would own The Last Unicorn a classic piece of animation in digital quality ! However Little did I know that the production company would put all of 2 dollars into the dvd release of this major film . First off it is only in Standard that is right the film has been cut from it 's original widescreen ( which is how the laserdisc was presented ) to a formatted to fit your tv mode . You can notice this most when mommy fortuna 's wagon passes by and half of the words are cut off from the picture . Secondly the digital transfer is AWFUL ! if I did n't know better they copied the VHS master onto DVD . the Colors are all blah and the animation is lost . This mystifies me because I also own the German widescreen version ( which is incredible ! ! ) and their transfer is flawless and crisp ! third , did someone forget the special features on this disc ? ! Play Movie or scene selection . that is it ! . Lastly this movie has The worst Box art EVER ! and it does n't stop there the art is also on the disc and the interactive menus ( which play some god awful made for dvd elevator music ! ) This release of an amazing movie is a crime ! Artisan ( the company ) should really rethink this and release a new transfer special edition . but that will never happen .
