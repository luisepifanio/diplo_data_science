I always try to get reviews from amazon first before I buy anything on the internet , but last week I was surfing around and found a site that offered this video and bought it becuse I had heard of bennett marine videos in the past.what have I done was my first thought as I squinted into the tv screen trying to make out what was happening in the very poorly focused scenes.I still dont know what they were using for bait or any other relavent information you would expect from a guide on saltwater fishing video.This video was absolutely the sorriest excuse for an informative video I could have ever imagined ! ! HOW DARE ANYONE CALL IT A GUIDEIts just an old home video of a weak fishing trip with three guys and a whining woman in the late seventies or early eighties at best.unfortunatly I found its reviews here after the fact.Stick to the saturday morning fishing shows and you will be 1000 times more informed.I would recomend high-hook videos for anyone looking to learn the proper way to fish or rig they are worth every penny.once again I learn the hard way ... ... .
