We kept yawning while watching this Sony stinker . It 's probably the worst digitally-animated movie we 've ever seen , and we 've seen all the biggies . BUT , we did give it 2 stars and not one because it does have a few fun scenes . But , those fun scenes are too few . It 's really lacking adult humor . Kids MAY enjoy it ( we 've got none so we ca n't comment ) . Please , do n't waste your money on this movie unless you 're sure your little ones might like it .
