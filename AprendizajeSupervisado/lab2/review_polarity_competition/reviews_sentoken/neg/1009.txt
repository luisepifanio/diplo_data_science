I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad ones were just people that had n't put in enough effort , but believe me I 've tried really hard . I still can not master the first dance , and I tried for over two weeks . When Tracy does the dance at the full tempo it just does n't seem to match the moves that she had broken down for you to learn . They 're only small differences and I 'm sure someone with better dance experience or more co-ordination might be able to do them . I think if one could master the moves it would be great and therefore I am truly dissapointed that I have n't been able to get to grips with it.However I also have the mat workout and her post pregnancy dvd and they are both brilliant . Obviously they 're not cardio , but they are really good at toning your trouble spots .
