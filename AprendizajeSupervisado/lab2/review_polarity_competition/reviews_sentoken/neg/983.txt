Like another reviewer , I am not able to load the DVD on my Toshiba SD-1200 player . I own quite a few DVD 's and have watched a lot of rentals and have not had any problems like this before now . I 'm quite disappointed as I 'm both a fan of Hitchcock and Criterion.Note : I contacted Criterion about this after submitting my review . They acknowledged a faulty pressing of the DVD and will reissue the DVD around the first week of November . You can also exchange your DVD with Criterion directly through the mail . Check out their website ... for contact information .
