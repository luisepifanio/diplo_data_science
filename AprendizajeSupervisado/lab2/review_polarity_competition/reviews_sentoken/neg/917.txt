I rented this because I enjoy westerns and because Michael Madsen is an actor I like . Forget it . In the first twenty minutes I completely lost interest - the acting was actually well below par for a high school production , and Madsen hardly in it . Apparently the director , Christopher Forbes , is turning out quick and amateurish productions with his buddies in most of the roles and a known name to headline . ( See the review here on Amazon for `` All Hell Broke Loose '' `` starring '' the late David Carradine . I did n't write it , but it sums up this movie too . ) The cover for this dog has a 'review ' something like `` 3:10 to Yuma rides up against True Grit . '' If there 's a `` con '' in getting you to purchase or rent a movie , this package is it . Save your money and re-watch either version of the two movies the cover references instead . Actually I 'd be mad if the whole thing was n't so funny and I hope I saved you a few bucks here .
