NOTICE : this is not really a sequel.This is one of those Television movie/mini-series remakes of a theatrical release . You will not get cinematic visuals , you will get TV quality visuals.Too many people are not providing appropriate reviews and this is more a betrayal of your consumer bethren.The original Storm Riders is an amazing fantasy tale , this is not . This is more like a standard kung fu action flick that uses the characters . Storm Riders had that fantasy feel , this does not . There is good kung fu action , but this thing seems incoherent while you are trying to watch it , and that may be because they have tried to cut and paste the movie together , if my theory is correct in that it was a miniseries adaptation . The story starts and stops with no flow.If you just want an action flick with some decent fight scenes get this , it 's tolerable , but in no way is it on the caliber of Storm Riders . I really wish they establish a standard that differentiates the TV adaptations from real theatrical releases , such releases tend to be a bit insulting.The ONLY thing that is redeeming for this is a really cute female actor , and that 's it ! I 've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive , and this is based off Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng . These 2 are appropriate , but no substitute .
