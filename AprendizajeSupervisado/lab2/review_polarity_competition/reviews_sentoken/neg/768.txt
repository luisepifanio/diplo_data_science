I love watching African dance and thought that this would be a great way to learn some of the moves and get a good workout at the same time.I 'm sure this is a wonderful DVD for those who have done African dance before or who pick up dance steps REALLY quickly . My problem was that the insructor would demonstrate the step very briefly , launch into the move at full speed , and then go on to the next step without much opportunity for the student to practice . I need to do a new step 3-4 times before I 'm ready to tackle the next one . The pace was lightening speed which is too bad because the moves are beautiful .
