For those of us who really like rock and heavy metal ( the kind og guy who buys hundreds of CD 's , that knows a about a band history , a band line-up , that know the songs for their names , etc ) , this movie is sacrilege . It 's utterly bad . It has produced damage to the already prejudiced image of rock . Wahlberg 's acting is lame ; the options for the soundtrack is absurd : the so-called band STEEL DRAGON is supposedly a killer band , witht hei own great original material . But the songs that STEEL DRAGON play in the movie , as if it was of their authory , are not ! ! It has one song from RAINBOW , another from DEF LEPPARD , it 's absurd ! Even as joke it did not work , because it was not conceived as a joke !
