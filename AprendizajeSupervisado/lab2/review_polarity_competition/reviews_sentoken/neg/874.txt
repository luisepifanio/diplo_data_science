First of all ; I enjoy Troma movies . I 'm not ashamed of it either . I like science fiction . I even thought watching `` The Postman '' was a decent way to spend a Thursday night.But this ... Battlefield Earth created the strangest atmosphere in my livingroom . The usual comments never came . People just looked at each other with some empty , sad look in their eyes . It is n't even funny . The only funny part is that John Travolta has tried to get this movie made for a decade ... I do n't understand why they had a list of the casted actors in the credits . You see , they do n't even tell you what most characters ' names are . Not until they die anyway.And in the end , when they get together and say `` Carlo did it ! `` , you do n't even know who Carlo was or what the poor guy actually did.As for for the credability , well , I mean it 's Sci-Fi . It 's okay . You do n't watch Sci-Fi for it . But I still have to quote this line from the film : Caveman in a military flight simulator : '' You 're right ! It 's just like riding a horse ! `` It 's good that it 's that easy , because otherwise the ID4-style air-to-air combat scene taking place one week later would have been impossible . Well , what would you expect from a bunch of people who joined a cult started by a Science-Fiction author . I 'm not going to say more than that .
