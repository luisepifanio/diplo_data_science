One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white movie is not an especially good movie . BUT , it is a fun movie . It is a silly horror/comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios . I love it . Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse . He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler ( Bela Lugosi ) . He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar . However , unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office . Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room . When he does try to get out , he ca n't open the door , etc . This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable . But that 's the fun of it . A huge dark creepy house , a will to be read , a suspicious looking butler and cook , a beautiful damsel in distress , a dim witted detective , a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased , murders , trick doors , screams and noises at night , etc . Of course , a very nervous and reluctant hero . This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide.I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun .
