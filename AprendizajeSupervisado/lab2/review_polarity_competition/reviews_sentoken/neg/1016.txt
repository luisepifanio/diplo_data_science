This movie could have been so much better , but they just had to ruin it , did n't they ? With the exception of very fine performances from Denzel Washington , Ed O'Neill , and Queen Latifah , the rest of the film just falls flat . The plot seems so ridiculous that I ca n't help but look away . Angelina Jolie 's acting is below average , but she did her best . The twist ending was n't very disappointing , but it did fall flat because of its exaggerated ( or lack of ) suspense . I did n't really enjoy watching this thriller . There are better ones like Se7en , and The Usual Suspects . Watch those two , and you 'll see how a real thriller should be.Grade : D+
