I have been practicing yoga regularly for about a year . I 'm familiar with Vinyasa flow and with Hatha yoga , and enjoy both . Unfortunately , Sybel 's Yoga was a disappointment . I kept thinking that she did n't know what kind of yoga she was doing : it was pose focused like Hatha , but the pace was extremely fast ( faster than most Vinyasa I 've done ) and there really was n't any flow to the movements . She jumped directly into poses without any breath focus beforehand , and instead of doing some movement to get the body warm , she started with stretching poses . This confusing pattern was continued throughout the dvd , as she switched between strength , stretching , and relaxation poses seemingly at random . Each pose was held for only 2-3 seconds before moving on , and the reminders to `` inhale , exhale '' were far too quick for good calming yoga breathing . Although Sybel mentions in the opening that her yoga is for people at any level of fitness , many of the poses included in this dvd are too advanced for beginners and would need a lot of modification for someone not at the peak of fitness .
