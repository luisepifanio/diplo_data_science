Chad Lowe 's portrayal of John Denver comes off like a Saturday Night Live skit . The fake singing and phony guitar playing are very apparent . He is not believable as John Denver at all . He whine 's throughout the movie . Kristen Davis is better but she ca n't save this disaster . This movie make 's John Denver look like a total boob which he was not . Save your money on this one .
