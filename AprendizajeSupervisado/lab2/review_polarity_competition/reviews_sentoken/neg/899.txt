Boy did I get screwed ! Having previously enjoyed this film as a rental from Netflix in standard DVD form , I took advantage of a special `` buy 2 get one free '' offer from Amazon on selected Blu-Ray titles . It never occurred to me that Fox would put LESS on the Blu-Ray than the standard DVD edition . SHAME ON YOU FOX ! ! ! ! ! ! !
