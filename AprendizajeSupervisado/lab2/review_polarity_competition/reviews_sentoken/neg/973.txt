Watch the American In Paris Blu-Ray and you will know what is wrong with Gigi . The opening sequence is grainy . The transitions from scene to scene are bad . It looks like the print jumps back to analog for a split second before the cut . I am very disappointed in it.If it was n't for the extras , especially the 1949 Gigi from France , I would dump it.Gigi is a great film and one of my favorites but I was expecting a better quality from Blu-Ray.My old widescreen VHS looks almost as good on the big Sony.And where is the Overture sequence ?
