i found this tape to be very easy . It did not raise my heartto my target heart rate at all i didn ; t even break a sweat i tried it again raising the fanny lifter to 8 inches still not a over all challanging workout . I still pefer the older firm tapes to the newer ones . They are more effective i find.Sinceanna benson has started her own tapes fitprime i find the firm has lost there edge . Anna Benson is the creator of the firm workouts pre 2001 .
