Maybe it was just me , but I did n't find this very amusing or interesting for that matter ... perhaps unlike others I do n't find Liz Hurley all that ... The premise of the movie is the lonely loser meets the devil and she gives him 7 wishes ... Ya ok , believeable ... The humorous parts were n't that funny ... and I think they could have picked a better loser than Brendan Fraser..although I think Liz Hurley played her part to a T ... I would n't recommend this film unless you like sappy lightweight humor movies ...
