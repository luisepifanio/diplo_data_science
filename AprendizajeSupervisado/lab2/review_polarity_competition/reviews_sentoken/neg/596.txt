Well , unless you have the coordination of a fine-tuned Olympian , you will be very frustrated . I spent over an hour just trying to WALK through the combinations in an attempt to learn them . I finally gave up when I realized it was futile . The actual routine is so fast and there is no instruction . You basically have to try and mimic each move which is impossible at lightning speed . I plan on returning it .
