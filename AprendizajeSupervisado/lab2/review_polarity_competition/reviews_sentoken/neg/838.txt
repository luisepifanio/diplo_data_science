I bought this thinking that I 'd be getting an installment from one of my childhood favorites , Hollywood and the Stars.This ai n't it . ( Ah , the perils of online purchasing ... ) This disk contains three chapters ( termed `` episodes '' ) consisting of WWII-related newsreel footage , but the similarity to Hollywood and the Stars ends there . Instead of narration by the inimitable Joseph Cotten , we 're treated to occasional commentary by Eric Sevareid . Granted , Mr. Sevareid is a legend among journalists but he just does n't cut it if one is expecting Joseph Cotten ( not to mention the late Elmer Bernstein 's gorgeous theme music ) .If you must purchase this , do so at your own risk and because its non- '' Hollywood and the Stars '' content is of interest to you , and not at list ( I got it fairly cheap from an Amazon third-party seller , but any waste of money is painful for me ) . For what it 's worth , I noticed that it 's playable in all regions , but I do n't know if it will make the conversion from NTSC to PAL . My advice is to not bother trying to find out .
