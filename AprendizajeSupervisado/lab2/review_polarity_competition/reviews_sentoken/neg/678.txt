Hostel gathered a lot of controversy upon release , and has spawned a generally queasy set of audience reactions . Many have responded with hatred towards the violent and unflinching nature of the film . My problem with it does n't lie with the violence.I ca n't connect to the first half of the film , which is mostly about regular foolish male behaviour while backpacking in central Europe . All of that becomes a long wait to see what awaits in the second half , and it provides very little buildup to what we 'll eventually have to endure.All of the violence in the film is harsh , personal and disturbing . It 's not entertaining , but in a broader sense , pretty interesting . It makes you wonder about the world , and what dark places may exist where anything or anyone can be purchased for the right price.This DVD contains some pretty good featurettes , and overall a really good set of extras , including one featurette which is almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction for the film , and how much of it is based in reality . Eli Roth is certainly an intelligent man , and he 's out to tell a message , not only shock , but due to the harsh and stark nature of the film , it 's hard to digest , and it 's overall too uncomfortable to be really memorable . Maybe there 's a little too much truth to Hostel .
