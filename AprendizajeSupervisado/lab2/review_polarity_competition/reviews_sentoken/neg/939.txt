This DVD is close , but no cigar . The movie should be 2.35:1 widescreen , but the disc is 1.85:1 . The picture has been squeezed as well to make it fit , giving the movie a weird appearance . They should have either made it pan & scan or else made it the correct aspect . Either one would have been preferable to this version . I ca n't recommend it .
