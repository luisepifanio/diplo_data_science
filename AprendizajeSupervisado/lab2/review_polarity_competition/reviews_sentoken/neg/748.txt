I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks ' The Mahabharata on DVD , and today it arrived . How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS . I have not watched this version yet , but I can not believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc . So a warning to everyone : if you want the full miniseries , THIS IS NOT IT !
