I know this DVD sounds great from the description ( added scenes , restored , 2 disc set etc . ) but be warned , it 's not the real thing . For a start the 15 minutes of added footage is NEWLY FILMED and awful . Not only that , it suffers from really bad lip-sync problems that make it practically unwatchable . Plus some original scenes have actually been removed . The other disc contains the un-butchered original but unfortunately has a new music score . Call me old fashioned , but I prefer the scratchy , corny original . Surely a Special Limited Edition should include the untouched original version ? ... If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
