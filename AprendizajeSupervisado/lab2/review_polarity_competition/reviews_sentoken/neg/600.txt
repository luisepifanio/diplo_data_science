I would not have purchased this product if I had read a review similar to the one I am writing . I saw Tracy Anderson on Oprah , dancing with Gwenyth Paltrow -- having fun , looking healthy . I 've had years of ballet training , I 'm in good shape , and , I respect Gwenyth 's lifestyle choices -- so , I bought the DVD . The method may be effective , but you 've got to be able to learn the routines . It would have helped the presentation and been more professional to have presented the steps by name ( either French , e.g. , glisade , jete , or English , e.g. , slide , change ) . Then , after allowing students to break it down with your back toward them [ which TA does do ] , it would have been fun and effective had each routine been set to music as students `` perform '' up to speed . Instead , all 8 routines are presented first -- each one viewed from the front , the back -- slowly , quickly -- and without music . The beginning of the DVD ( trying to learn the routines ) feels like practicing calisthenics slowly while a coach counts from 1-8 over and over -- it 's boring and it does n't does n't feel like dancing . I never learned the choreography past the first routine . I tried skipping ahead to the dance portion ( with music ) but never having done the routines to music and not having the names of the steps called out , I could n't keep up and never reached a cardio workout .
