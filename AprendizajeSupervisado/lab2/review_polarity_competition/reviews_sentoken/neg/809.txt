I got this video with the understanding that it will provide me with the basics of yoga , and that I will progressively become better at yoga and more comfortable practicing it . The video provides a series of on screen explanations of the basic yoga poses with a little graphic . It is very hard to read on the screen , the colot is too light , and helps very little . The video is very good for those who have been practicing yoga for a while , and have a good understanding of it . I tried all the programs contained in the video , with no success at being able to follow the motions , and very little knowledge of how to do it . I had to buy a basic yoga book to understand the yoga positions in detail . The DVD is now sitting on the shelf . I do not recommend thid DVD for beginners . This is a more advanced video .
