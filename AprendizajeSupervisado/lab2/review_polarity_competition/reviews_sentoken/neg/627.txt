I love the Murder She Write Series and greatly anticipated the show being released on DVD . I have both Season 1 and Season 2 . I love watching the episodes themselves , but am very disappointed in the quality of the DVDs themselves . I understand that it is not happening with every DVD set , but a lot of the sets ( including both of mine ) have DVDs that skip and stop . I have to skip entire chapters of the shows just to get to the next episode . The problem is using both sides of the DVD to store the episodes on . If any research had been done on two-sided DVDs prior to putting this wonderful show on the cheaper two-sided format , then we would not be having so many DVDs sets skipping . I really wish they had gone for the better quality route and not the cheaper route .
