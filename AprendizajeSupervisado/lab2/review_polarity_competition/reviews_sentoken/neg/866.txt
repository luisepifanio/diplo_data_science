This version of Jane Eyre is one of my favorites . I excitedly preordered this DVD a month ago when I found out about it . Unfortunately , I can only give this DVD two stars . That is one star better than the last `` remastered '' release that I reviewed ... the extra star is due to the fact that THIS one is at least not missing an entire scene.Far from being remastered as claimed this release is , if you can believe it , even worse than the other I reviewed . First , it is dark & muddy -- I had to crank up the brightness on my TV up almost all the way in order to see any detail at all . Second , the picture is almost constantly filled with long scratches ( sometimes right through the middle ) , both white & black `` drop-outs , '' and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen throughout the entire front credits . Third , the color fluctuates several times throughout the film . Fourth , in some scenes the sound is a bit scratchy.And to top it all off the release company ( VCI Entertainment ) , not content to lie on their packaging , had the GALL to insert `` This Special Edition motion picture has been digitally restored to its present condition '' before the film . There 's 'truth in advertising ' for you.I ca n't figure out why it is so impossible to get a GOOD release of this film . But I am tired of releasing companies lying about remastering it . Do n't piss on my leg and tell me its raining .
