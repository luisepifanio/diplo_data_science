... first , I was looking for a DVD that would give me helpful instruction in how to perform particular poses to ultimately decrease my neck/shoulder pain . I do n't find language such as `` ground your body in the Earth '' and `` pull your shoulder blades into your heart '' very helpful in making sure I am doing the poses correctly . Perhaps this DVD is meant for those with a background in yoga ( in which case I probably would 've chosen a slightly different title , as the current one has a good chance of drawing in anyone who is searching Amazon for solutions to neck/shoulder pain ) . Second -- and this was the straw that broke the proverbial camel 's back for me -- the instructor and her pretty male companion both went into deep squats ... and anyone who has been instructed in doing squats knows what the following means : the male 's knees were hovering over the floor in *front* of his toes . After watching him in that position for 10-15 seconds , my own knees insisted I turn the DVD off and thank my lucky stars I 'd gotten it from the library . My quest continues !
