Whatever you do , DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE ! Fearless Hyena II on DVD is one of the worst DVDs I have ever had the unfortunate experience to waste money on . The transfer of this DVD is horrible and whoever is responsible should be forced to watch this over and over ; it is THAT BAD ! My impressions : THE DVD has no menu or special features . Pressing the MENU button on the remote simply causes the playback to flicker for half a second . Pressing the GUIDE button on the remote takes you to a white screen that does nothing and remains blank.THE TRANSFER is horrible . It appears as if they set up a recording device to record direct to DVD a straight projection of the film on a cheap screen . There are even film scratches and spots and the entire screen is blurred and distorted beyond recognition . The sound is muffled as if you are in a padded cell listening through a tin can . The dubbing of British accents over the dialogue really throws you off when the use odd phrasings . The acting is nonexistent . It seems as if it was cut together in a rush and several scenes are missing . In one scene , you see Jackie Chan walking down a road in a marketplace and moments later you are cut to his character 's father in the middle of an action scene as the house burns down around him.The quality of the movie is less than what you would get taping something off CBS without cable . HORRIBLE RECEPTION HERE ! My recommendation : DO N'T BOTHER !
