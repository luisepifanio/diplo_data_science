There seems to be some confusion among the Amazon reviews about this product . `` Death Mask '' is a low-budget horror film starring James Best ( of `` The Dukes of Hazzard '' TV show ) as Wilbur , a socially awkward carnival geek who nurtures a frustrated love of women . Although he finds himself falling for Linnea Quigley , romantic feelings that are at least partly requited , Wilbur simultaneously becomes attached to a beautiful death mask that forces him ( liberates him ? ) into becoming a killer . I ca n't say that I have an objective opinion about this film -- I 'm not a fan of the genre and only picked it up because I went to high school with a cast member -- but it struck me that James Best had some real talent and I do n't know whether to be impressed or saddened that he put so much of it into this sort of movie .
