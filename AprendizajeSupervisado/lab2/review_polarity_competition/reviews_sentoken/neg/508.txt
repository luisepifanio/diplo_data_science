I was really excited to try out the Tracy Anderson method , but when I got the Dance Cardio DVD , it was nothing like what it said it would be . The dance combinations are difficult , and you need to spend time learning all the combinations before you can even start the workout . It is a total waste of time and a total scam , since they mention nothing about this on the DVD or on the website . I tried to return the DVD but the customer service is horrible here . They took over a week to get back to me , and then said they can not return OR exchange opened DVD 's . But how the heck would someone know if they are happy with it before even opening the package ? Beats me ! Total scam if you ask me . I 'm very bummed that the customer service is so awful . You are much better off spending your money on something from a store where you can return it , or buy a workout DVD that actually provides a workout , not a bad dance instructor and false advertising.I would actually rate this DVD zero stars , but this review thing made me at least put one .
