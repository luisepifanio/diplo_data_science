This DVD is an interesting collection of interviews and news footage . It 's what you would expect . You will see a young Carrie Fisher , Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.The DVD is kind of choppy in its presentation , but the interviews are interesting and the look into the past is very nostalgic . I did n't know what to expect when I bought this , but I was n't totally disappointed.The Star Wars fan will love it , but the general public ... may get bored . There are no DVD Extras of note either .
