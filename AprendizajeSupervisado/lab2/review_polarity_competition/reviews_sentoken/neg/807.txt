I 'm a Blu-ray enthusiast , and a Lethal Weapon enthusiast . So , I was VERY disappointed in both the quality of the Blu-ray formatting for this ( it looks like DVD quality ) , but what REALLY mad me upset is the fact that it 's not the directors cut . I guess that perhaps it was a bit naive of me to assume that it would be , but come on , this is BLU-RAY we 're talking about here ! I was not impressed . Not to mention that the seller said it was in `` Good Condition '' , but the spine and back of the sleeve was severely crumpled and torn . Had this been a good quality Blu-ray conversion , and it been the directors cut , I would have cared not regarding the crumpled sleeve . However , as it was not the case , the crumpled nature was the straw.P.S . I just checked on Amazon , and there 's STILL no Director 's Cut available . Until there is , I will not be buying any Lethal Weapon films on Blu-ray .
