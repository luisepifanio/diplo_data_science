I have also danced all of my life and have no problems picking up routines . I had the hardest time trying to follow her combos though . When she breaks it down , she does n't use the same beats that she uses up tempo . When she repeats a combo the second or third time , she does n't do the exact same moves again . I do n't believe she was ever a professional dancer.The biggest reason I do n't like this is it is HIGH impact . Not for an aging lady like me , definitely not with my hard floors.On the other hand , I also have the mat DVD , and I really like it .
