Missing dialog ! ! ! No kidding . If you want to be stunned by the fact that miscellaneous , important dialog ( 28 seconds worth ) is actually missing buy this . It is actually quite a joke . I can not belive that this is even available . Check out ( regular http address prefix , then ) film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/71678/night-of-the-living-dead.htmlfor some of the missing dialog ( scroll down ) as well as a fair comparison of this Blu Ray with Optimum 's version.This disc should be pulled from distribution . Buyer beware ! I wish I could give it less than one star ...
