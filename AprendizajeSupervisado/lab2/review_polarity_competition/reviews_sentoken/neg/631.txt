This is the first Star Trek movie where the people of the Next Generation are featured . Also a few of the original characters are involved . That is where it starts going downhill . We are introduced to the substance tri-lithium , which can kill suns . Data at last gets human emotions , and the two Captains get to work side by side.However , they turn the 1701-D into a weakling of a ship , by having it taken out by a single strike ( not even a salvo , really ) from an obsolete , delapidated klingon bird-of-prey/scout-class wessel ( as Mr. Chekov would have called it ) that was flawed while it was in service . I realize they wanted a knew set , but she should have died harder . And Admiral Kirk 's death was not enough to do him justice . This was supposed to be a transitional movie , but the first generation , while not really going out with a whimper , certainly did not go out with a bang . It was more like a groan .
