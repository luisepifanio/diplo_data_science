At the end of this movie Janet Jackson 's character drives her soon to be ex-husband to his death and winds up grinning at the end of the movie as she gazes upon her next sexual prospect . This movie ended like a horror movie . It is a terrible example for any Black women who might be watching . That kind of aggressive , sadistic behavior is what you might read in the news , not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama was supposed to be . I hope Black women do not watch this movie and think this movie ending was okay because it was quite sinister . The Black men also seem unusually weak while the Black women appear dominant . No man really wants a loud mouthed , dominant woman , no matter what Tyler Perry says . This movie gave me nightmares .
