I thought Doom was the worst adaptation of a video game . Uwe Boll proved me wrong . Pathetic attempts at British accents , a horrible script , and the worst performances out of every actor in this `` film '' . I never thought ANYONE could make Meatloaf look `` feminine '' .When one reviewer compared it to a porn movie , I beg to differ . They are better actors with a more believable script.Now I understand why the previews were so cheaply made . They were the best parts of the movie .
