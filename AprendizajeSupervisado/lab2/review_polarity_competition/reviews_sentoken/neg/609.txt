As a movie the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining on its own but when compared to the book it is horrible . There are several instances where Hollywood had its way with the plot . The revelation about who Alberts real father is being the worst . This did not happen in the book . The movie lacks the style of the book . The Count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never stooped to getting is hands diry himself . I also do n't recall any sword fights in the book ( although they were decent , but nothing spectacular ) . As I said , taken on its own the movie is entertaining but it deviates terribly from the book which is superior in everyway .
