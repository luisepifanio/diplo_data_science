My daughter has ordered four sets of this season and not one of these sets will play good enough to watch . The first two sets were Christmas gifts . The second sets were replacements for the first two and they would not play either . We tried them in different dvd players to no avail . I ca n't tell you how disappointed we are . It looks like we will have to do without the second season until Universal gets their act together . I also doubt if the third season will be purchased . To anyone buying these dvds , good luck .
