This is a decent movie but I can not give it a better review because the transfer is terrible . The monogram , ER , of the issuing company shows throughout the whole movie . This is definitely a very low definition version of the movie . Maybe the system the company used to add their monogram made the film look like it 's being watched through a gauze . There are also some places where the picture breaks up.This is really a shame because I enjoyed the movie .
