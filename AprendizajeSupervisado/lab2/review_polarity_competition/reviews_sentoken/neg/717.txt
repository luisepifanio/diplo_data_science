I recommend that you do n't buy this edition of Conan . The movie is one of my all-time favorites but the audio transfer of this film was completely screwed up by Universal and key music from the Basil Poledouris score was deleted from the film . The incredible score is one of the things that makes this film shine . Shame on you Universal for putting out an inferior product and trying to dupe consumers .
