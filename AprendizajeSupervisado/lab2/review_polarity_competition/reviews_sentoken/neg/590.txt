I love a good vampire movie whether is scary like `` Nosferatu '' or campy like `` The Lost Boys '' . Unfortunately I can not say the same for `` Bloodrayne '' which is neither scary nor campy . What I did n't like the most about this turkey of a movie was the way it edited . There was no real beginning . Everything the viewer learns about Rayne ( Kristanna Loken ) is through a series of annoying flashbacks . I can not believe that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was tied to this awful film at least `` Species '' was actually scary , disgusting , yet entertaining . `` Bloodrayne '' is neither . Up until now I never thought a love scene could be so hilarious ( unintentionally ) until I saw Rayne and Sebastian get it on . It was so bad that it was funny . Although the two Underworld films really do n't offer anything substantially at least those films were entertaining , `` Bloodrayne '' was not . Bad acting , bad writing , bad everything . Apparently Hollywood has not learned from past disasters that video games do not make for good films ( i.e `` Super Mario Bros. '' and the `` Mortal Kombat '' films ) .
