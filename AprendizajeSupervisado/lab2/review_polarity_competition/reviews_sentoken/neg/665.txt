As many have said , this version of the film is inferior to it 's earlier incarnations . I 've watched this film on TV and VHS since I was a child . I 've loved it ever since and never got tired of it . I was SO disappointed in the Warner 's DVD release . Half the music is subdued . And worse , half the sound effects are missing . The clanging of swords . The screech of the Eagles . The sound of Sting slicing up Spiders . The sound of Glamdring cutting down Goblins . Many more . All gone . They even cut bits of dialog . At one point , Bilbo looks like he 's just talking to himself because the off camera dialog is gone . The movie has been rendered dead and lacks of emotion . I hope they correct this with a future release . H3ll , if nothing else , they could just get the Laser disc ( remember those ? *heh-heh* ) and rip the soundtrack from that . Anything is better than this , Warner . You 're an old company . You know better .
