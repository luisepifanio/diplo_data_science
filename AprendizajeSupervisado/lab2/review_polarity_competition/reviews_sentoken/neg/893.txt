Okay , so these guys had UNFETTERED access to the most anticipated band reunion , well , ever ... and this is it ? This is all they do ? Do n't get me wrong , it 's nice to see the guys playing again , and watching Kim get sober along the way , wander the towns , etc . But the main problem with this doc is that it 's absolutely BORING . And they fumble the key issues in all true fan 's minds : the reasons for the breakup , and the possibility of new music . In fact , the best part of this movie ( aside from the music ) is the impromptu interviews of the fans Kelly does . She starts asking questions ! What a concept ! This is such a wasted opportunity . The film makers were either inept , or too star-struck and `` honored to be chosen '' to make a film with any depth . We 're left with a lazy , fly-on-the-wall love letter . Tiptoe filmmaking.Look , I love all things Pixies . Period . And on a certain level , this is a nice to see just because I love this band so much . And if you 're a big Pixies fan , you will probably enjoy it to a certain extent . But again , from a FILM standpoint , and what this piece SHOULD have been about , this is a gigantic let down .
