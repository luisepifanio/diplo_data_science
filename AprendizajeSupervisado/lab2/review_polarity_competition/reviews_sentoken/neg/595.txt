Amazon is still combining movie reviews.There are about half of dozen DVD versions of `` The Snows of Kilimanjaro '' .Amazon combines all of these reviews , so whether you get a DVD with excellent quality or terrible quality all those reviews are applied to all of the versions of the DVD available for sale.I purchased the most expensive one `` The Snows of Kilimanjaro ( Remastered Edition ) '' and the quality is terrible . It looks like the movie was shot through a dirty window.The DVD case has black trim and shows Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck sitting at a dinner table . Avoid this version ! I will now try purchasing other versions of this movie from Amazon I 'm hoping to find the one and only good one . I read all of the other reviews and was not able to reliably determine which one is the official studio release.Amazon 's policy of combining movie reviews is financially wasteful and damaging to the environment.UPDATE : Buy the one with the red/brown border , ( mountain peaks are visible above Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck on the case cover ) . This DVD looks great ! !
