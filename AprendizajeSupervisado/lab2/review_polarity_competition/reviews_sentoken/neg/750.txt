The acting in this movie stinks , laughably . Even Tara Reid ca n't save this film . What , Reid 's a scientist because she puts on glasses ? She looks more like a gym trainer . Is Christian Slater any smarter ? The direction is almost as bad as some Ed Wood movies . The movie may have had a science fiction plot , but the film hardly explored any part of its plot . The film is not only bad , it 's sometimes boring , only stimulated by the amusement to scriptlines horridly carried out and meaningless action . Mostly , this film incriminates its director.I give this movie two stars out of five . This film at least had some visuals . I did n't hate its stupidity as much as that other movie also based on a videogame , `` Resident Evil : Apocalypse '' which I considered the worst movie of its year .
