I do n't understand what constitutes a comedy these days . Here is another `` comedy '' that is unfunny and focuses too much on the same tired jokes , mostly sexually related , without trying to develop any kind of storyline . The acting is unremarkable , the script is below par , and the direction seems uninspired . What a winner ! Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play newlyweds who at the beginning of the film are returning from what was clearly not a great honeymoon . They act like kids , running each other into walls and throwing gum into the other 's hair . We flash back to their meeting ( Kutcher hitting her in the face with a football ) and subsequent romance . He is a graveyard shift traffic reporter for a radio station , while she has had all the education possible and is an avid art lover . The honeymoon is in Europe . Right away you should realize what some of the jokes will be . How about trying to plug something from America into the wall when the outlets wo n't fit and the power is twice as strong ? ... Ha Ha . Then there 's the jokes about European hygiene , with huge bugs crawling on our heroes when they are in the next hotel . Driving in Europe ? Then you have to get one of those suitcase sized European cars that ca n't be a worse shade of yellow . Oh , and no extra points for guessing that an old flame of Murphy 's will show up and try to steal her away.All in all , this movie is bad . It 's not the worst thing I 've ever seen , which is why it has two stars instead of one . But this is completely brainless storytelling , we 've seen it all before . We 've just usually seen it better .
