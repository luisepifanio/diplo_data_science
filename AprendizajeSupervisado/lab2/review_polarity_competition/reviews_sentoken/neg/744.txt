As a parent I very much enjoy watching Thomas shows and movies . I rather like trains and Thomas is the standard for child train movies . However this movie is a dramatic deviation and has a thoughtless story line decorated with absurdity . In short , Thomas accidentally drifts off to a island five miles directly offshore of Brendam docks . Despite the FIVE MILE undersea train tunnel linking Sodor to Misty island and the close proximity to shore , none have seen Misty island . Thomas meets new trains on misty island ( Dash , Bash and Ferdinand ) who were sent to exile on the island for being not really useful and together they work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a rescue station . Everything works out in the end but they waste valuable story time by logistical reasons of finding some of the people who were out finding Thomas before he rescued himself ( if that makes sense ) . It should have at least made sense to the writers that this was a horrible story.Also , introduced in this story is the Captain ( a boat ) who is the only one who has an English accent as all sea-going people have English accents.Finally , Hit entertainment , who puts together Thomas movies , makes getting to the actually movie another logistical challenge by removing function of the `` menu '' button thus bypassing previews is only achievable through pressing the `` skip '' button a million times . I though i was paying for the movie not Hit entertainments free reign of smothering my child with previews of their other products .
