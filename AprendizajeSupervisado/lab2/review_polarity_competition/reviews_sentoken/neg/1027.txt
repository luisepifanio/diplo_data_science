This inept movie does n't have much going for it at all . A kind of JURASSIC PARK with the billionaire messing around with genetics and coming up with three nasty sabretooth tigers . The script calls them huge but they do n't look all that big to me and the CGI effects are way below par . The cast is pretty ineffectual too , with Robert Carradine doing a Jack Nicholson impression , Nicholas Bell being properly British and boring and Stacy Haiduk trying to exude sexuality but not accomplishing it . The subplot involves , what else , a group of mindless college students who choose this resort site as a scavenger hunt for new pledges . There 's no suspense but there is a bizarre ending in store for Mr. Bell that 's fairly innovative . No real bite in this one , though .
