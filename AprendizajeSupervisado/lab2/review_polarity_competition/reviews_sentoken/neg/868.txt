The only way this type of butchered travisty will not happen again is to vote with your dollars . This remake , which aired on A & E , is one of the worst efforts I have seen in a long time . Get the original PBS version , also available on Amazon , if you want to get the feel of the real story , or buy the book . Sometimes failure is important to learn to be better and to stop under-estimating the audience . This 2002 production has a lot to teach about failure . Unfortunately , for those of us who know the original production and book , it 's an unnecessary lesson that is unbearable to watch .
