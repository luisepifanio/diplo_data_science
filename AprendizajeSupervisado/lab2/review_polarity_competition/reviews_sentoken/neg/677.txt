THIS IS TERRIBLE ! I ca n't believe it 's by the same person who wrote Phantom of the Opera , Les Mis , Cats , ect . The music is not memorable , the lyrics are sophomoric and and the plot line is complete crap . It changes history as presented in Phantom , and characters ' personalities are completely altered to make it work . The Phantom flees to Coney Island to start up a circus/freak-show after the events in Paris . Madame Giry and her daughter Meg follow him . Meg becomes a burlesque dancer and obsessed with the Phantom . Madame Giry wants to hook them up . Christine , Raul and their son get drawn to Cony Island to open a new opera house , but the Phantom convinces Christine to sing at his show instead . Raul is now a mean , gambling drunk and Christine is now in love with the Phantom , who has changed from the pitiful , screwed-up , dangerous Genius of the original musical to someone who plays by the rules and is mild , self-sacrificing , and likes clowns and bad Carnival music . Oh , and by the way , it is revealed that Christine slept with him the night before her wedding and Gustave is actually the Phantoms son ! Everything about this musical is SO , SO BAD . Spare yourself the pain of watching it .
