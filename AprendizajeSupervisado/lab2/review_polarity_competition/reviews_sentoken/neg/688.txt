As a fan of occult horror films I 'm always on the lookout for a good one -- they are few and far between . `` Hell 's Gate 1111 '' came pretty darn close . It had a great premise , and even though the storyline was a bit murky through the first half of the movie , it moved along and straightened out rather nicely toward the end . The problem with the movie was the end . It was much too abrupt and so confusing that one wonders if it is n't quite complete . Personally , I think the production company ran out of money and just slapped some alternative footage in to finish it off .
