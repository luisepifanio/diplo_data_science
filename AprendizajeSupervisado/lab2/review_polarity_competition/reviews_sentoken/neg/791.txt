Reviewers who have watched the Region 2 DVD version of this film insist that the 10 additional minutes in that version make all the difference . This version misses the mark . How could it miss with Ben Elton writing and directing and Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson in the lead roles ? Answer : it skips the process that the couple needs to go through to come to some peace with their situation . One scene `` all is lost '' and `` presto chango '' in the next is all resolved . This leaves the main characters as card board cutouts for a comic plot . Still its worth watching for the stylish send ups of the BBC , modern London , and some very funny scenes . Richardson is dazzlingly georgeous and Laurie is charming and wonderful . Laurie 's sperm-test song is a keeper . Just do n't expect that touching moment that make every thing work -- someone , somewhere , somehow forgot to write , shoot , or include it in this version . But , oh would I love to see the Region 2 version ! Explain to me why in the world Amazon does n't sell it on the U.S . website ? ? ?
