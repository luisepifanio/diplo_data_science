I watched this movie for some sign of a redeeming quality ; and found none . The acting was terrible , the action scenes were dramatically staged and unrealistic , no plot , and they did n't even try to make it humorous . If you watch the special features , they beat the living daylights out of the main character who got injured numerous times during the creation . I felt bad for him because he was really trying . If they had a halfway decent director or photographer , they could have used this guy 's effort and hard work to make a good movie . If you want to watch a good B action movie , rent Equilibrium or Dark City . Skip this one .
