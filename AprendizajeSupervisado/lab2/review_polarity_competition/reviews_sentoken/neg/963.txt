I am trying to get back in shape . I can do the Leslie Sansone 2-mile walk no problem , but after about 20 minutes of this DVD , my heart rate was way too high and I was actually starting to wheeze . This is a good workout , and something to build up to , but very discouraging for a true beginner . Also , everyone in the DVD is VERY fit - not much encouragement here for someone just starting . Also , '' jumping '' included , which is just recipe for a beginner injury . I think beginners should avoid this workout .
