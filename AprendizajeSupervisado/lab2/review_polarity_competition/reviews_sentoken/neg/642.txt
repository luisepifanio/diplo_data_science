You 'd better like ham if you plan to make it through this movie . Nutty old millionaire John Carradine dies and puts a stipulation on the fulfillment of his estate on his four children and three servants via a cranky tape recorded will in which he expresses nothing but loathing for everyone and says bizarre things like `` this might separate the rabbits from the alley cats '' then laughs maniacally . They have to spend a week in his house or they will fail to get their share of the inheritance . Every single person in the film is wholly detestable , and by the halfway mark I did n't care how the film ended as long as it was over.After the kids are ensconced in the house , they all start dying in a variety of odd ways which are all lamely presented : Johnny is killed in a convenient tank of piranhas , another 's head is found under aluminum foil on a platter in the refrigerator , a couple are killed by electrocution in bed , one is shot through the head , etc . There are additional features such as Carradine making an adult dress up as an organ grinder 's monkey , gratuitous ax to the head action ( one of the worst special effects ever ) , ravenous insects , whipping , a servant named Igor , and overacting the likes of which are rarely seen.The film plods on , and it 's obvious how the conclusion will play out about halfway through the film . A special mention goes to the final line of the film addressed directly to the audience `` And I bet you thought it was the butler all the time . '' Also of extreme annoyance value is the closing music , which borders on the unlistenable . I gave this film two stars ( generously ) for the minor , yet hilariously hammy , performance of John Carradine . Truly a master of horror in his day , but an even greater master of overacting when his day had passed .
