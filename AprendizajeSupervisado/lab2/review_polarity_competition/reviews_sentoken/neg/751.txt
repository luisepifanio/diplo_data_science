Yes , that 's right . Despite Universal 's desperate and shameless marketing attempt to make this package appear somehow extensive or definitive , they were still unable to get around the fact that , no matter how you slice it , Smashmouth only has about 16 minutes and 12 seconds of presentable material . And , frankly , I think they stretched it pretty thin .
