The Ally McBeal series was one of my favorite shows ever . I wanted to have the complete series but it is not available in the U.S . However , it is available in England ( amazon.co.uk ) and I bought the complete 5 season set . I knew it was coded for Region 2 ( Europe ) and would not play on DVD 's sold here , so I bought a Code Free/Region Free DVD player and recorder for about $ 200 and now can enjoy the series from start to finish . Region/Code free DVD 's are available on the Internet and are a great deal . If you really like Ally as much as I do and are annoyed you can not buy the entire series here to play on your current DVD , buy it from England and get yourself a Region/Code Free player or player recorder at a reasonable cost .
