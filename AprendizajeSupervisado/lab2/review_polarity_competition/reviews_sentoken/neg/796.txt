I was really disappointed in Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout . I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the Urban Rebounding Compilation DVDs.The first sign of trouble was in the beginning interview on the tape , which showed the host , presumably Dr. Sneider , with a gigantic pot belly . That is n't the role model I was looking for.To be honest , if you do the workout on this video , you will get a good overall workout . But the video is so repetitious , completely lacking in enthusiasm , downright boring , and unprofessionally produced . For the rebounding part , it does the same very few movements , not very imaginitive , over and over . When changing from one movement to another , the camera is almost never focused on the teacher 's feet to see what she is doing , so you can only guess . The `` class '' consists of a bunch of totally out of shape , rhythmically-challenged people on the front lawn of the Royal Hawaiian hotel . They do n't exercise in unison at all , and the camera is usually on them , not on the teacher . You must have hand weights to do the program.For the abs part of the program , during much of it the cameraman forgot to focus the camera at all . The two people are just blurs . Also , there is just no point at all in doing your abs or yoga or pilates moves on a rebounder . It is downright uncomfortable to do so , and you can get a much better workout by doing them on a mat , without injuring yourself on the hard rebounder frame . While the exercises in the abs and yoga parts were good , I strongly recommend getting a different non-rebounding DVD , like Candlelight Yoga ( very excellent ) with Sara Ivanhoe . That has many of the same moves as the yoga part of this workout , but safe , well taught , professionally photographed , and above all , ENTHUSIASM.This was just a very , very boring , repetitious exercise video . The Urban Rebounding compilations are not perfect , but they are MUCH better .
