I love this movie . It 's the best depiction of what it must have been like to fly with the U.S. Army Air Corps in Europe . I have seen it literally dozens of times . I purposely waited for the BluRay version so that I could have the best possible quality picture . Instead , it 's grainy and not much better than the DVD version I recently rented . Very disappointing .
