For this movie , I would KILL to be able to score NO STARS ! ! I do n't know who came up with the notion that this movie was **supposed to be funny ! ** but this simply is n't true.First of all , it would have been advertised as a `` crazy camp movie , '' secondly , it would not have been so obscenely overplayed by the star , John Travolta , whom , I remind you , gentle reader , has followed Scientology , and was a card-carrying , toga-wearing , purge-your-past-lifes-sins-by-being-hooked-up-to-two-aluminum-cans-connected-to-a-volt-meter follower of L. Ron Hubbard himself , until his death in 1986.To say that this movie is even abysmal is an insult to abysmality . It 's not funny , it 's stupid , ridiculous and tries WAY too hard to impart the demented ravings of a self-proclaimed demi-god .
