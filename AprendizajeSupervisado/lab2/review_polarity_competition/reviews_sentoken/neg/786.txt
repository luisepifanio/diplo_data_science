This movie barely touches on the holocaust . Some of scenes that it does show from the holocaust were actually scenes from when the people were liberated , not when they were being brought to the camp , which made me think that the movie was just thrown together , grabbing a few scenes from youtube . I could probably say in one breath the amount that was quoted from the diary . It 's more a movie about a woman who does n't get along with her mother , is popular on her radio talk show , and her marriage is in trouble . Then there 's some stuff about a woman in Poland who left her diary to her daughter . It 's not a good movie no matter what tags you put on it because the acting is bad and the story line is worse . Save your money and skip this one .
