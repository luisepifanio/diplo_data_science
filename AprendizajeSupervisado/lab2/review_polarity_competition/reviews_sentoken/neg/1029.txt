& quot ; The Breakfast Club & quot ; is the brat pack movie that I venture to guess will be long remembered as a watershed moment in American cinema - at least where teen comedy is concerned . The plot ( for those not already familiar with it ) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life , forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session . A hilarious , well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human , John Hughes & quot ; The Breakfast Club & quot ; is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.UNIVERSAL 's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own . Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays , this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD . Colors are dated , unrealistic , often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing . Fine detail is minimal , even in well lit scenes . Contrast , shadow and black levels are all extremely weak . Age related artifacts , including chips , scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident . There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation . The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation , except in the music tracks.EXTRAS : A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.BOTTOM LINE : & quot ; The Breakfast Club & quot ; is a brilliant movie . However , the lack of extras ( a documentary would have been nice ) and the really low brow treatment of the transfer lead me to say this disc really is n't worth the money .
