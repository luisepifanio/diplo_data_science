It is just unfathomable that anyone could possibly think this was a good idea - take a beloved classic film and:1 . Cut 15 minutes of footage.2 . Add 15 minutes of poorly shot new footage with excruciatingly bad acting , writing and direction.3 . Dump the original music score and replace it with painfully amateurish electronic drivel.4 . Add insult to injury by deceptively marketing it as the definitive 30th Anniversary Edition.Words can not express how terrible this edition is . Really , it is THAT bad . I have seen student films and amateur fan edits done better . The new footage is so badly written and acted it would almost be funny if it was n't cut into this classic film.Stay far , far away from this version . Get any other version that has the real Night of the Living Dead .
