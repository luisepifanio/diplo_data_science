I faintly remember the game this movie was titled after and was a fan of some of the old Christian Slater movies , so even after being told this was a horrible movie , I decided to rent it . I have an odd fondness for bad scifi movies because it 's fun to see how ridiculous the writing is and how bad the special effects are , not to mention all the no-name actors are trying to pretend like they can act.Unfortunately this film was not fun in any way , shape or form . Christian Slater is a good actor and the movie seemed to have a halfway decent budget for the creatures , which were animated fairly well , but other than those two points this movie did n't even qualify for a `` direct to Sci-fi channel '' release . There was no fun in this movie at all . The story made no sense at all , the support actors were very stiff and none of the characters seemed to care anything about any of the other characters . At one point in the movie Christian slater mentions `` I just killed my life long friend '' in the same way you would say `` I just spilled my coffe on an onld stained pair of pants I was just about to throw away '' . I guess that could sum up the entire movie . The actors did n't seem to care , the director did n't seem to care , the editors did n't seem to care , in fact the only prople who seemed to really do a halfway decent job were the animators who animated the monsters.After watching this `` movie '' I just felt very sad for Christian Slater . His career must be completely over now . I 'm depressed . Time to watch Madagascar and cheer myself up .
