I own a VHS copy of ALICE IN ACIDLAND , purchased from Something Weird years ago . I am a big fan of 60 's exploitation / drug trip flicks and ALICE IN ACIDLAND has always been one of my favorites.I finally upgraded to DVD and I was completely disappointed.This DVD of ALICE is a cut , censored version of the film . Ten to fifteen second chunks have been lifted here and there , leaving jarring jump cuts in their places . And near the end of the film , an entire scene has been eliminated . The cut footage is all shots containing full frontal nudity and/or the more brutal violence.The cuts are obvious - no attempt was made to make them flow with the movie ... the music and voice over narration cut awkwardly with each instance of trimmed footage.The run time info on the box is even wrong ... on the box , the original run time of ALICE is listed : 62 minutes . But the version on the DVD only runs 53 minutes with all the cuts.I have been a Something Weird fan for years ... But now I am disappointed in the company . They used to be a haven for unfiltered , non-PC , full-on-raunchy exploitation , horror , psycodelic , and just downright odd cinema ... stuff the masses would n't care for . So why CUT a movie to ( presumably ) appeal to the masses ? ? ? I 'll hesitate before I buy another Something Weird DVD.I give this DVD 2 stars instead of one because the other material on this DVD is quite good . But I do n't think this DVD is worth your money .
