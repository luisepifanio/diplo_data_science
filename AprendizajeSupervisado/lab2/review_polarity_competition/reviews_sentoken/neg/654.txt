Unfortunately , Universal continues to use 2 sided dual layer without much success . The 3rd episode on the first disc was unwatchable . This happened in the 1st season as well . What 's up with this ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Ca n't they provide single sided DVDs and quality ? -- - Universal must not have anyone that actually sits down and watches it end to end . I do n't get the set to return it multiple times and finally just end up keeping something I ca n't watch all of . What a shame as Murder She Wrote is a true classic .
