My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have the unrated extended cut of the DVD version and the PG-13 theatrical cut of the Blu-ray version . My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version ( either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player ) . Ultraviolet is no exception . Moreover , the look of the film seems to soften details , which really defeats the point of Blu-ray.Aside from no improvement in the look , the Blu-ray version has no more special features than the DVD , and the extended cut DVD has seven additional minutes . Go with the DVD version on this one .
