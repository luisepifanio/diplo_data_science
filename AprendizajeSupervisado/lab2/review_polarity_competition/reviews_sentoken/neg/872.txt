To behold this musical on a NYC stage is an unforettable experience and I went and saw it four times . But to see it on film is a totally flat experience . It just does n't work on the screen for me . Although you 've got a top talented cast , the incredible energy and electricity that bolted across the stage are nowhere to be found here.The musical is a nitty , gritty story based in dank , scroungy Village surroundings , filled with nitty gritty people living on the edge . Since I lived in NYC for 30 years , I instantly felt at home with this hidden world that the average person ca n't imagine . But to spend two hours in a movie theater , watching this dank , depressing story unfold , is a dark experience . The musical numbers all seem forced . The people are n't very likable . They 're all too dramatic and intense for one 's comfort zone and the reason the movie bombed , is that middle America probably could n't understand why the people in this movie just did n't pay the damned rent -- and avoid all the drama and problems ! This movie did very well in large cities where there were people who could identify with this bonhemian story of tragedy and AIDs . But even for someone like myself who is very familiar with this world , which takes place in the Village , where I lived , it 's a dour , depressing experience with very little to feel upbeat about.I could n't sympathize with the druggies and the prosties nor did any of the musical numbers electrify . They should have gotten a fresh , new cast for the movie version and opened it up more from the dark , always damp , world that enfolds this film treatment .
