We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell . It really did n't keep me son 's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room . His other Sesame Street video Let 's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings . Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it .
