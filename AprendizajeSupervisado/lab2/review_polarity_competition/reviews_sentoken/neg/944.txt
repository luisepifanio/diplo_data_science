Well , I saw this in Costco yesterday and picked it up as it is one of my favorite movies from my childhood . Me and my little brother used to rent this on VHS from our local rental place every year around the first of summer vacation . The movie itself is great for a made for TV movie , it is just as good if not better than the series animation . The show itself is five stars all the way , so why did I only give it two stars ? . . .The quality sucks . If you put it into a computer and check the size it is only 3.7 GB , not even an entire 8 GB DVD , so they went the cheap rout and used a single layered DVD . You can tell this when you play it because it is an interlaced DVD , google interlaced DVD for more info . Basically this is for playing on OLD TVs not the current HDTV ones . It also looks like they used an old VHS for the rip instead of using original sources or even a LaserDisc , those huge record sized DVD discs , they had a much higher quality than VHS and did n't degrade over time like VHS does . If they ripped from one of those it would look much better . They also did n't take much time on creating menus , when you go to watch trailers and switch languages it is a very boring plain blue menu with no sound . I could have done a better job with free software on the menus . Also , the discs were made in Mexico , they could n't even splurge enough to have the made in the US.I 'm glad it is on DVD now but for something I have been waiting this long for I 'm upset that it is such low quality . I can up the quality a little by ripping it and running a decomb filter to get rid of the interlace but why the heck could n't they have just put out a higher quality product ? I also know a few people with LaserDisc players , I might just buy the LaserDisc of this and have them rip it for me , burn it to DVD and put it in this case . The case is nice and looks good with my other DVDs and Blurays .
