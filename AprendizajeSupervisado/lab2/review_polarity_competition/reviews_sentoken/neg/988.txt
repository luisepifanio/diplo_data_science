Movie excellent Bronson/Mifune ; DVD release horrible . I received the version with the white backdrop with the red sun and color sketch of Bronson , Mifune , Andres , and Stamp on the cover . On the packaging Evergreen Entertainment is indicated as the DVD producer ; in the Amazon description it refers to Evergreen as the Studio . It looks like quatlity from the outside and says it has been remastered and that format is letterbox . Not true . It is a poor transfer form a video and is cropped , not even close to letterbox and the sound is poorly mastered . Even the menu mispells words . Amazon has really confounded reviews that try to protect other buyers of DVDs and CDs by combining the reviews for all prints of movies and CDs . Good luck in sifting through the offerings now . I will get a good print and letterbox of this movie if I can find one with confidence , but can not so far .
