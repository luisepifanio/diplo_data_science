I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again : the studios really need to stop letting tiny , amateur production companies release their movies on DVD . This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a prime example of why . The most obvious and infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synched up to the action ; it 's about 2 seconds behind . Unless you enjoy `` the boys '' looking like a dubbed Japanese movie , this is going to drive you crazy . The picture quality is also really poor ; I have a VHS copy of `` Flying Deuces '' that looks better than this . The trivia game was a nice idea , but poorly executed ; `` what color is Stan Laurel 's hair ? '' How would I know -- -all their movies are in BLACK AND WHITE ! Oy . I thought I was getting a nice double feature for a good price , but I ended up getting what I paid for : cheap movies . Save your money .
