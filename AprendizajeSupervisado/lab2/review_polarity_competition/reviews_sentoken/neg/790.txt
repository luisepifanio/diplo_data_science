I bought the Unrated Director 's Cut of this film with great anticipation . I loved the theatrical release of Pitch Black . It is one of my favorite science fiction films , hands down.But the Unrated Director 's Cut ? Is a waste of money . The additions to the film were so few and so subtle , I barely noticed them . The Unrated part ? More violence ? Not noticeably . More cussing ? More bare skin ? No , neither of those . And the extras ? Are almost non-existent . There 's nothing on this DVD that I did n't get on the first one , except some hype about the sequel , and not even that was very convincing . Seriously , if you already own this film on DVD , do n't waste your money on this reissue.If you do n't own this film on DVD , see if you can find the original release . At least it has the theatrical trailers .
