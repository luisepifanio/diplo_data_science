If you are a true Al Green fan you will be extremely disappointed with this DVD . Al spends 75 % of the concert rambling on about nothing of importance , another 20 % messing around with the audience and about 5 % actually singing . Do n't waste your money ! I only wish I could send it back and get a refund .
