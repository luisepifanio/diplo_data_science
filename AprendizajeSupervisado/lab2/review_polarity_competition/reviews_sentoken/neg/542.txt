It 's a great movie . Unfortunately my four hour mode vhs off air copy made about 30 years ago is a superior recording to the dvd I just watched which I presume is the current release , having bought it Jan 15 , 2010 . There is no question whatsoever that this dvd was mastered from a vhs . How can I tell ? When the `` hi-fi '' audio tracks of a vhs tape mis-track it produces a very distinctive fluttering sound . This dvd is full of that sort of mistracking . Then there 's the overlap at the reel change where approximately 45 seconds of the show is repeated , followed immediately by a breakup and an upcut that omits about 95 % of one scene . For a commercial release this kind of quality is totally unacceptable . There is a special place in the hereafter for the `` engineer '' who mastered this piece of crap . Here 's a thought : Forget the fancy menu and the so called `` extras '' and try giving the customer a clean recording of the program .
