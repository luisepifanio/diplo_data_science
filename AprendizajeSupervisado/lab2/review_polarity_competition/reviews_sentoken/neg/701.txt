There is a major discrepency here , the product description and reviews reflect the movie storm riders which was great , but `` Wind and Cloud '' is a TV mini-series which might be ok if you get the entire series , but Best Buy sells a cut version of the series on 1 DVD which I bought and was very dissapointed . Do not purchase the 1 disc version of `` Wind and Cloud ''
