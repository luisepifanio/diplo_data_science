This is a remarkably bad presentation of the `` great battles '' of World War II . To begin with , in an alleged introduction to the causes of WW II - probably written at a time in 1946 when the Soviets had to be pleased - the authors do not EVEN MENTION THE SOVIET-GERMAN PACT OF 1939 ! ! ! ! The rest is a superficial , long winded , boring collection of news footage and other pictures , with poor sound and rudimentary texts . To be avoided .
