Alice in Wonderland is the tale of a little girl lost in a land of nonsense . A land of NONSENSE ! This movie has hardly any nonsense at all . It feels more like a Harry Potter movie than Alice in Wonderland . I wanted Alice . Alice get 's trapped in a surreal dream-like Wonderland where everything is nonsense and there is tons of wordplay , puns , ect.And the nerve to name the movie Alice in Wonderland . It 's not that story . They should 've named it Return to Wonderland : The Battle to Make a Harry Potter movie with Alice Characters .
