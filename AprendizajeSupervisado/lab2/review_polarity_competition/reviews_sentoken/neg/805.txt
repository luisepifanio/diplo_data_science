A great adventure in the Monty Python style . Always difficult to find on DVD , it was a pleasant surprise to see it re-released . Unfortunately , this version is designed for television , and a full twenty-five minutes shorter than my original VHS version . In spots , the editing done to shorten the film is amateurish , and the tacked on generic water sounds used to fatten up the original audio for surround sound is more a distraction than an augmentation to the movie . I will be keeping my VHS tape while awaiting a true DVD release .
