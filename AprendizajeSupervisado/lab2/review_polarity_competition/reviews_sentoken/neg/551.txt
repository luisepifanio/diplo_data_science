I am very disappointed in this film . Mostly because it seems like it is talking about two different subjects at the same time . On the one hand , the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology , who fairly effectively trace the history and progression of postmodern thought . On the other hand , there are the two film makers who simply discuss their unhelpful and sometimes irrelevant to the discussion ideas.The brothers Williamson are asking questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more to do with their own personal dissatisfaction with the church . It 's like they made this film to throw out their own ideas and advertised it as a film on postmodernism . While some of the interviews with the experts are helpful in clarifying trends in postmodern thought , this video as whole is unhelpful as a whole .
