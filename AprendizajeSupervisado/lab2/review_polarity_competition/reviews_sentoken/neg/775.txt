This movie was n't great at all ! It did n't follow the book for one second ! I thought this movie would turn out like the book that I read in High School , but it SUCKED ! It was like they did n't care enough about the central points that made the book work in the first place . I feel that the movie ripped me off because the characters in it did n't connect to the book at all ! First of all , there 's Agnes Bruckner , who played Vivian . She looked nothing like the `` Vivian '' in the book , her agenda and motivation were not the same , her personality was completely different from the book , her performance in the movie was poor in that Agnes just was n't in character most of the time . The script was very stale and terrible ! My imagination longed for more drama and accuracy . The red-haired woman who played Esme ` underplayed the character ( for whom was the most important hench-villaness in the book ) . Everybody 's acting in this movie was just too flat in general ! Whatever you do , avoid this movie like the plague ! This movie was n't even scary or clever . For those of you who loved the book , do n't BOTHER with the movie because it 's a DEAD END !
