I have been and still am a loyal fan of Xena and Gabrielle . Let me remind those who liked the ending of something . Real Life is full of saddness , misery , loss and tragedy . We watch TV and movies to escape reality . Xena was a tragic figure in the beginning of her life . She killed for little or no reason . But she saw that she was wrong . She changed her ways and fought for justice . There is no way to bring those killed back to life . But Xena repented and devoted her life to fight for good . She risked her life many times in order to save the lives of countless others . ( Let those without sin throw the first stone ) We need a heroine like Xena . We want to see that those in the `` white hats '' win and the bad guys in the `` black hats '' lose . I know that reality does not work out that way many times . But Xena was different . She is special . I think it is most digusting , very tragic and pathetic that Xena had to die . And if dying was n't enough , beheading her made my stomach turn . I own the entire series . But I will never , ever watch the last episode again.I gave this two stars because Xena 's tragic and unnecessary death puts a blemish on the whole series .
