To be frank , I watched the movie because of the talent behind it . Unfortunately , I was disappointed with virtually every aspect of this movie . There are times when the action bounces back and forth between two sets of characters and situations ( a la Fifth Element ) but there is little or no connection between the two situations , which leaves me dizzy and confused instead of entertained or stimulated . There is extreme character development , such as the numerous times we see Peggy ( Laura Dern ) slipping off to take a nip from her flask or pouring herself a drink . The idea of her alocholism is pounded into my conscious to the point of annoying me , and then I found that the fact that she has a substance abuse problem has nothing to do with the plot , the character interaction or anything else for that matter . Why did Robert Altman make such a big deal of it then ? Filler ? The obsession with the Kennedy family for Connie ( Tara Reid 's character ) is another case where a good amount of time is spent in trying to show us this side of the character and it is never followed up with any tangible purpose later in the movie . Strangely enough , she is probably one of the more 'normal ' women in the picture . All of this would have lead to a mediocre movie but the ending really killed it for me . I have no idea what the ending is supposed to mean . In fact , it reinforces the idea that the whole plot was derived by the writers completing several Mad Libs pages and then editing them into a screenplay . There is really no other explanation for why so many aspects of the movie seem to be so random ( or haphazard at best ) .
