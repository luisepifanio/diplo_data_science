This film is about a script writer who is teaching at a university . He rambles on and on about cliche in movies , and yet this movie is completely guilty of them too . The movie is too predictable by the end . It may not have the 'girl runs upstairs , instead of outside to safety ' thing , but it does have the typical 'guess which of our 5 characters introduced during the whole movie done it ? ' so it has failed to try and be smart.So the main character finds himself receiving phone calls and receives messages on his machine from random people , begging for his help , as some psycho has a gun to the heads of the victims ... which leads to him being the # 1 suspect , and he has to try and figure it all out to prove his innocence . The plot is far from original , but watchable , and as I said , predictable , so once you see the ending , you will probably think to yourself that you saw that coming a mile away . I highly doubt you will have no intention to ever see it again.A rental , or d/l at most , but not worth purchasing .
