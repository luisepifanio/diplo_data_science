This had to be the most painful DVD experience I 've ever had . The music on tis DVD was so idiotic it drowned out everything , making it completely incomprehensible.Equally as bad as the music the producer seemed to want video of himself walking about in almost every shot . Not to mention almost the entire dvd is made up of collages of images superimposed on top of one another , making none of them clear enough to even see correctly.I 've bought hundreds of books and dvd 's from Amazon and this is the first that has motivated me to actually post a review . It is that bad.I ca n't even comment on what the producer said , I could n't hear any of it . Stay away would be my advice , a total waste of money .
