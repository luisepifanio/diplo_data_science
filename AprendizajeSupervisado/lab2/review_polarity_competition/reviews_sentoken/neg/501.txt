A long time ago , in a ... .This movie also starts out with some scrolling text , too bad it takes nearly five minutes . On the positive side , when the text finishes , you could save yourself about 90 minutes of anguish and walk out . This film definitely will challenge `` Plan 9 From Outer Space '' as the worst horror movie ever made . The biggest difference between the movie and video game is the reset button . I kept looking for one in the theatre . You 'd expect second rate acting from Tara Reid but not Christian Slater or Stephen Dorff . The love scene , if you could call it one ( I do n't remember any love scenes in the game ) has successfully set lovemaking back 1000 years . Congratulations Uwe Boll with continuing the fine tradition of B-Movie making . Ed would have been proud .
