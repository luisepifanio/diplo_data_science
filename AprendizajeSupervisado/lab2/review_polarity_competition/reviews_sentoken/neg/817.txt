Madacy has done it again ... taken what could have been decent DVD 's and turned them into trash . The video transfer from film is very poor , but the worst is the audio . Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality legacy DVD 's , just look at other reviews of Madacy titles ( check out Charlie Chaplin DVD 's ) . This is a shame because younger folks who 've never seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression .
