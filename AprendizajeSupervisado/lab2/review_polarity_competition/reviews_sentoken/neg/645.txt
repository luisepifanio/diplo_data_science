I wont even go into the story line or the actors roles . I want to ..I have to tell everybody about the transfer to DVD of this classic movie . The picture looks like a bad VHS copy done by an amatuer ! The sound ... ..oh my God the sound is absolutely horrible ! I watched this on my Sony 36 inch tv and I immediately cleaned my DVD player thinking there was something wrong with it ! I adjusted the sound on my Sony ES ( Professional Grade ) Reciever several times and into several modes from Mono to Theatre EX to basic stereo and nothing would improve it . MGM be ashamed ! ! LOUIS B MAYER is rolling over in his grave ! ! !
