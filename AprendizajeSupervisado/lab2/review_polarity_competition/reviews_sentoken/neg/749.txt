When lifelong friends Charlie Carbone ( Jerry O'Connell ) and Louis Booker ( Anthony Anderson ) accidentally get mixed up in the mob , they are forced to deliver a large sum of money to some shady characters in Australia . When a wild kangaroo `` steals '' the money before it can be delivered , it 's an all-out race to catch him to get the loot back before the mobsters find out it 's missing . Silly slapstick ensues , but Anderson and O'Connell make a good comedy team.A mix of real and animatronic kangaroos were used.Staci Layne Wilson
