I agree with Shemp Newberg 's review . I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs , which I 've raved about . I got this one to begin learning bottleneck . The tab is not what he 's playing ( or rather , he plays 80 % plus embellishments ) , so you ca n't duplicate his songs unless you can play by ear . Very disappointed . Guess I 'll seek another intro to bottleneck . On a positive note , there are terrific historical clips of bottleneck legends , if you like that stuff ( which I do ) .
