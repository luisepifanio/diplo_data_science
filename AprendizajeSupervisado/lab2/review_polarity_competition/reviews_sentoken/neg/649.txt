( 5/3/12 , 1 star for this Blu-ray release , 5 stars for the movie ) I have the regular DVD with English subtitles , which StudioCanal inexplicably has omitted from their Blu-ray version . Why would they do this ? To make a few dollars more profit ? Apart from the callousness , it 's surely an erroneous financial calculation on their part . There are countless cinephiles with less than perfect hearing who will probably pass on this release . My wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to catch all the dialogue , especially when the actors have British accents . She wo n't be watching the Blu-ray version , and since we always watch movies together , I wo n't either . I 'm guessing there are millions of viewers worldwide who feel the same way .
