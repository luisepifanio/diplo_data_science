The only reason I have given this a single star , is because I could not post this comment with NO stars , but it deserves none.Quick , do yourself and true film fans a favour , GO FIND THE MILLENIUM EDITION OF THIS FILM , AND BUY THAT ! THAT version IS the definitive DVD version of the original classic.Clean images , clean audio , great supplements and commentary.THIS version ? Well , let me put it this way.You will appreciate the 30th Anniversary Edition of NOTLD only if you think it 's okay for the guy who built the frame for the Mona Lisa to repaint it with lousy colors.Or if you think the guy who delivered the blank tapes to Capitol and Apple should legally be able to recut and remix all of the Beatles tunes.This DVD is a travesty.John Russo has no talent to make a NEW film ( a quick glance at Children of the Dead will bear this out ) , so he continues to ride the wave of the original NOTLD 's classic status to give himself permission to destroy the very elements which made it a classic in the first place.To remove 17 minutes of original footage is enough of a crime.To replace those scenes with 18 minutes of amateurish , poorly acted and poorly conceived 'new scenes ' is the bottom of the barrel stupidity.Add Scott 'Anton LeVay-as-Preacher ' Licina 's horrible acting and derivative , irritating and ineffective score , and you 've got a recipe for a lousy DVD.Is the picture good ? Yes , but since this is NOT the original film , it 's hard to praise the technical merits of this DVD.It saddens me to think there are people who did NOT see the original NOTLD before this dismal failure was released , and may think THIS is the definitive version.It is most assuredly not.Even if you ca n't find the Millenium Edition ... even the grainy , cheap public domain $ 5 DVD 's at discount video stores are better , if only because they are showing the REAL original film.This one is a crime .
