This is a fantastic movie , but please read other reviews regarding the acting , camera work , plot , storyline , etc . This review is only about the DVD version.The DVD itself is a major disappointment . Poor transfer , no extras , no surround sound , full screen only , and hardly even a menu or chapter selection . Like the other Stanley Kubrick DVDs in this white-box series , this Full Metal Jacket is pretty much a VHS dub of the movie - only thrown together onto a DVD . I 'm suprised that it 's not double sided like the original commercial DVDs were . Given the advances in DVD technology when this disk was released there was no need to sell such a lackluster product , besides trying to get as many Stanley Kubrick movies as possible into one big boxed set before Christmas of 1999 . This movie , The Shining , and to a lesser extent , A Clockwork Orange all suffer from this same exceedingly poor DVD treatment.Hopefully soon this movie will be re-released in a better DVD package , much like Goodfellas or The Shining needs . Until then , buy this DVD only if you 're a huge fan or if it 's laying in the bargain bin .
