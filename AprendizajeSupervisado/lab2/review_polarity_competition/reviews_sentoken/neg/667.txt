I saw this movie in the theatres and have the soundtrack . It 's one of the best film scores ever ! But then when released on video it 's in MONO ! What gives ? Whoever decided to do that is ripping off the public , in my opinion . I know it was in stereo at the big screen , so mr DVD producer ( and LD and VHS ) why not now ? Folks , this movie was designed as set pieces based partly upon the musical score ( see the Varese Saraband soundtrack CD for details ) . To release it in Mono is a sin . Save your money . It 's really not worth owning as it is now .
