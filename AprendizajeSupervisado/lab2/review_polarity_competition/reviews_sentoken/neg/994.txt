This type of DVD 's are good source when you just want to have a certain video of your favourite artist . But the picture quality of the first video , & quot ; La Paga by Juanes & quot ; is just terrible.Then & quot ; Llorare las penas by David Bisbal & quot ; is blurry and the audio is really bad.I think these companies should provide at least the same quality as shown on Cable or Satellite broadcastings.Maybe I am asking too much , but that 's just my opinion.If you do n't mind buying this DVD for 4 of 5 artists and not caring about its quality , then get it .
