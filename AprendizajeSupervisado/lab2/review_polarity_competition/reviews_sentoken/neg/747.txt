As a former Marine who lead patrols in Iraq I can say that this is the worst portrayal of Marines I have EVER seen . Almost every second of this movie makes me sick . Marines DO NOT conduct themselves in this manner AT ALL . Do not think for a second that the United States Marine Corps would put up with a single Marine acting in this manner much less an entire unit.If you are an Anti-American , Anti-Military , propagandist than this movie is for you . It is obvious that this piece of dirt was made by that kind of person . *******THIS IS A FICTIONAL MOVIE THAT IS WAY OVER DRAMATIZING AN UNFORTUNATE EVENT******* do not for a single second think that the FINEST men and women of these United States conduct them selves this way .
