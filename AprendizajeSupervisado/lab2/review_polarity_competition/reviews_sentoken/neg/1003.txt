`` Battlefield Earth '' is rightly considered one of the WORST movies ever made . It makes `` Manos , Hands of Fate '' look like deep , human , poignant drama about suffering at the hands of a cult and `` Plan 9 from Outer Space '' look like a profound meditation on world peace & the perils of science . `` Battlefield '' has plot holes larger than Swiss cheese -- and to think it was a labor of love ( ! ! ! ) John Travolta saw this movie as a tribute to L. Ron Hubbard . But it ended up a catastrophic flop . And no wonder . `` Battlefield '' has humans living in primitive conditions , at the mercy of the dreadlocked Psychlos led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker . Human civilization lies in ruins . The special effects , at times , especially with the ruins , are convincing . Too bad about the rest of the movie . Barry Pepper ( who seems to have retired , or something ) stars as the hero , '' Jonny Goodboy . '' Not making that up . Held prisoner by the Psychlos , he manages to learn how to read , fly planes , fire guns -- all in a remarkably short amount of time . As for the Psychlos , what was their motivation in world domination ? Gold ! And yet they were n't able to find Fort Knox after blowing everything to smithereens.Dumb premise , horrible acting , a horrific make-out scene between Travolta and his real-life wife Kelly Preston ... it 's best to be missed . This movie makes you suffer Moment by Moment , and Travolta wondered if his career was Stayin ' Alive . At least his taste in camp movies has n't changed , since he starred as Tracy Turnblatt 's mother in Hairspray ( Full-Screen Edition ) Bad movie love is a battlefield .
