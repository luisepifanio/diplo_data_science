The DVD contains everything that the editorial review promises but in really poor quality . The DVD disc is a DVD-R that the manufacturer reproduced very cheaply and although the cover says that it is digitally remastered , the quality of the DVD is really quite appalling , being very amateurish and in some parts , simply not watchable . Although the content will make me watch it again , I 'm really disappointed that I 've had to pay so much for something of such poor quality .
