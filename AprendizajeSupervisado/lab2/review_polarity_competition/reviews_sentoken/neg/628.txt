When Bruce Lee passed in 1973 , 2 films were pieced together in an attempt to cash in on Bruce Lee mania via splicing together some of Lee 's best moments from the Green Hornet series , and thus making 2 90 min . `` Bruce Lee films '' to the joy of those who were anxious for more Bruce Lee footage . The first was entitled `` Green Hornet '' , the second was entitled , oddly enough , `` Fury of the Dragon . `` What we have here is the official sequel to the first 90 minute Green Hornet feature . An identical approach in that the production is made up of various scenes from the Green Hornet tv series ... and the result ? In spite of some good moments and fond memories of watching Bruce Lee get down as a superhero and hearing his REAL voice , we 're left with 90 minutes of awkward splicing together of stories that do n't blend . I even recall seeing a few fight scenes from the 1st movie . If you ask me , what we have here is a shadow of what was to come in 1978 ... 20th Century Fox 's butchering of Bruce Lee 's Game of Death . The only difference was that they spliced together footage alone as opposed to throwing in an unconvincing double with 10 minutes of real footage . Either way , this one 's a keeper for die hard Bruce Lee fans , one that 'll be worth lots in the near future . But yet aqnd still , I have to call Green Hornet vol . 1 and Fury of the Dragon ( Green Hornet vol . 2 ) what it is ... BRUCEPLOITATION nonetheless . MAY WE PLEASE HAVE AN OFFICAL GREEN HORNET BOX COLLECTION ? THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO PURCHASING THESE 2 SPLICE JOBS IS ON THE BLACK MARKET & I DO N'T STEAL . SOMEBODY HELP A BROTHER OUT . LOL ! WORD OF WARNING : Make sure that your DVD player will play PAL discs before purchasing this dvd . My copy will only play on my Windows Media Player ... it 's region 1 , it 's not a bootleg , but it 's being PAL will make all the difference as to whether or not it 'll play . Be careful .
