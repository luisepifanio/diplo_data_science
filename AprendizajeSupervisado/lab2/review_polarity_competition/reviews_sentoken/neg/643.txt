Still disappointing . I really had hope but between the garble 'd lines and poor acting it was pretty hard to stomach . I think the wolves chasing the vampire was the highlight of the movie . It completely lacked any emotional connection , I think it was actually worse than twilight if that 's even possible . It completely amazes me that with such a huge budget and fan base , they still ca n't even get close to getting it right . The cheesy outfits , the make-up , even the soundtrack was bad . Go read the books , there 's no comparison .
