The movie is one of my favorites the Duke ever made . I was really excited to see it on DVD . I ca n't describe my disappointment and frustration as I watched it over Christmas . The recording of the movie was made from a very poor film copy . Many scenes are blurry - totally out of focus . Film scratches are continuous . Do n't buy this - wait for someone else to re-master it so it 's watchable !
