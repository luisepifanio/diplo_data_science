`` I Know Who Killed Me '' is a vile little horror outing that was designed as some sort of `` comeback '' vehicle for Lindsay Lohan back in early 2007 . Needless to say , the movie did not succeed in that endeavor . Anything but.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming , an attractive , but relatively naive high school student who falls prey to a torture-crazed serial killer who manages to slice off a few of her limbs before she miraculously escapes his clutches . When she wakes up in the hospital , she believes herself to be a girl named Dakota Moss , some kind of fictional `` alter ego '' with a life straight out of a soft-porn novel - which provides us with ample opportunity to ogle the scantily-clad Lohan as she writhes around in slow-motion performing pole-dances at a sleazy strip joint . Is Aubrey , who is herself a writer of fiction , simply a victim of repression , a wild and free spirit so obsessed with being a `` good little girl '' that she ` s allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious all these years ? And is the trauma she 's undergone simply the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore ? Or is there another , less purely psychological explanation - let 's say , symbiotic twins ? - for this sudden shift in identity ? It does n't really matter what the answers to those questions are , for this depressing foray into sadism , dismemberment and supernatural hocus pocus is poorly written , amateurishly acted and completely lacking in either thrills or common sense . Actually , the story itself might have had some validity had it not forced the audience to wallow in as much gratuitous unpleasantness as it does . But , as it is , whenever we begin to develop even the meagerest interest in what is happening , we 're subjected to yet another round of stomach-churning bloodletting . Yuck .
