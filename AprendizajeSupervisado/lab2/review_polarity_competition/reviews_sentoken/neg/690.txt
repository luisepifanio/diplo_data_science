Yes , The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD . Personally disappointed in this point very much . it does n't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray . SoPersonally Hondo [ Blu-ray ] I think it 's not necessary to buy this blu ray version expecting better picture quality if you already have the dvd of this movie .
