I watched the movie and felt like I was missing pieces , that scenes were shorter , even that entire scenes were missing , but it had been so long since I watched it I just thought I remembered the movie being better than it actually was . Then I watched the director 's commentary . He took at least 15 minutes away from the movie . Most director 's add to their movie when given a chance , not take away from it . The Director 's Son created a disjointed , fragmentary movie very unlike the original in mood and plot.After waiting years for the DVD release of Erik the Viking , I was extremely disappointed and a little angry at the way they treated one of my favorite movies . I hope to see the Theatrical Release available some time in the near future , as I do n't think I 'll be watching this Director 's Son 's Cut again , and I certainly wo n't be sharing this version of the movie with friends and family as I had originally planned .
