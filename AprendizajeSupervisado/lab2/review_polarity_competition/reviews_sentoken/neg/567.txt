Please be warned ! ! ! I love `` The Lost Highway '' , but the quality of this import version is appalling ! The resolution and color make it seem like the movie was downloaded from the internet . Some scenes are so blurry and dark that you can not even see what is going on . And believe me , I have seen this movie many times as a rental , and the poor quality of this particular DVD version is not part of the `` artistic '' effects . It 's just poor quality . Please do not waste your money buying this version ! I had to send my back in because I was so disappointed !
