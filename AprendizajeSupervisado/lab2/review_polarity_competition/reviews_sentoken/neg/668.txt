Cybill was a great show , and most of the episodes on this 2-disk set are fun to watch . BUT-there are only 13 episodes in total , 10 on disk 1 and only 3 on disk 2.What is REALLY irritating is that 2 of the 13 episodes are part 1 of 2-part story-lines , and the episode with part 2 is not provided for either of them ! This is either the most incredible stupidity on the part of the producers of these DVDs or ( more likely ) it is a deceitful attempt to wangle sales of additional DVDs to people who would like to see the finish to the story-lines begun on this set . It can hardly be accidental to have not 1 but 2 incomplete stories ! I would strongly recommend against wasting money on this pair of DVDs .
