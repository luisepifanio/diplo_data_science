Was JK embarrassed by this blunder ? egad this was truly a dissapointment , and the delusion that it was fine cinema , or five stars is only on the track of it having Potter as a label . Potter fans around the globe would give it accolades even if Freddie Prinze Jr was playing Severus Snape.A poorly executed screenplay , the CGI was adolescent , in a world now taken over by the mass marketed Transformers and the like , you think they would have called Stan Wintson in for some fun , this was truly a first year at the New York Film Academy type work . The plot was acerebral . Rupert Grint is wooden , plastic and insignificant . There was absolutely no character development from jumpstreet , and equally no suspense.We are yoked into believing that because it 's Harry Potter it 's going to be good . I am such a huge fan of the book series , and naturally the books are usually better than the films , but [ this ] compared to the book , was a true washout . Personally I find Branagh a superb method actor , he played a fine Hamlet and his movies are very thoughtout and distinctive , however the miscast here is evident , as he was unmoving , and commonplace.In closing the whole package seemed rushed , irrelevant , unbecoming of the worldwide sensation of Rowling 's , uh , epics ? , and like Augusten 's `` Running With Scissors '' , definitely stick to the book.A two star rubbish .
