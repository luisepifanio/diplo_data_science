It pains me to have a negative review when it comes to Harry Potter , but this is over the disc and not the movie . I love the series and would love to be able to watch it again ! Here is the problem . When I first received this movie , I was able to watch the BlueRay a total of two times before it would stop after the intro . The third watching attempt was a few days past 30 days and it would stick with no option to get to the movie . The DVD version plays just fine . After a little struggle , Amazon made a one time exception and replaced it . Now , after receiving it and deciding to watch it again I am encountering the same thing . This time I am SOL . I have a top of the line Sony BlueRay and have never had any other issue , so I know it is not my player . Maybe they were given a bad batch from WB ? Did anyone else have this issue too ?
