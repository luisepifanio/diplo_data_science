Beware ! ! ! ! If you are a 'Dirty Dancing ' fan you will realize this edition has some scenes that are missing from the original movie . I 'm extremely disappointed in this DVD . I tried to find the edition that had all the scenes , knowing there was one like this out there . No one stated in the reviews that the movie had been edited . I watch this one anyway just because I do n't want to take a chance on ordering another one and have the same thing happen again . I would gladly pay the money for a complete movie , but no one seems to state this in the reviews . Order a different version ! ! !
