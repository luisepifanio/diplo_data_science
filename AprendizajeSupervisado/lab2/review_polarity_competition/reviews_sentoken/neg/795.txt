This is a blatant rip off by Amazon playing on the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hoping that no one will research past the 2 minute preview u get online to find out about the movie . I later found out that the movie is an indie film that was done in 2002 . The worst part was they charged a HD quality price of $ 4.99 for a grainy low budget film . The lead character is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it 's the norm to create an illusion and rip the suckers off - and that 's exactly what I feel happened here !
