I 'm an avid Horror movie goer . My taste in horror flicks may not be the best , I 'll admit I am a little picky , but they still have to be worth watching . This movie has no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever . I watched it with a group of people and by the first five minutes none of us knew what was going on , yet the ending was easily predictable . It was one of the worst horror flicks I 've ever seen . I would n't recommend even renting it .
