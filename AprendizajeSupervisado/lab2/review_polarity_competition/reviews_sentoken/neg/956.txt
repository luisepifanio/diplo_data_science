Uwe Boll has got to be the worst working director in Hollywood ! How does he get money and actors to work in the trash he calls film ? Michael Madsen gives a wooden performance and Ben Kingsleyis slightly better . I guess they figured if they just showed up and spoke their lines then the director would be happy . Anyway pass on this movie is you are undecided .
