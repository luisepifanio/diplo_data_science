I think the title and the way it was shown on the Video was misleading and I ended up buying a wrong product . I had heard about a new series from Discovery and BBC as a follow-on to Planet Earth and decided to purchase it on Amazon . When I received it I realized that it was from a different company and had no relation to the excellent work done by Discovery . The big capital letter name for the video is misleading .
