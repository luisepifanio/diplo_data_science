I just bought this movie for my Wife for xmas , being one of her favorites , we were looking forward to watching it , however , the disc itself is severly lacking in quality.1 . No Widescreen ? Criminal on a new DVD these days.2 . No Digital 5.1 surround sound ? Musicals are a must for the digital treatment.3 . Extra 's ? Very basic behind the scenes stuff , nothing spectacular.So much could have been done with this excellent film , but unfortunately it hasnt , buy it if you love the film , but dont expect all the extra 's , or you will be sorely disapointed .
