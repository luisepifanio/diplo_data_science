Denise Austin or Kathy Smith fans beware ... ... ... ... I am a healhy 37 year old who exercises regularly to fitness videos and I find this video difficult . There are a lot of arm movements and holding your arms up which put a lot of stress on the shoulder and neck muscles . I find myself tense and sore and I eventually end up with a headache from the over-strain . I love music but I also find the choreography to be difficult to follow unless you have dance background . Also , there is no instruction or calling out of movements , it is basically trying to follow Tracy as she dances along in her studio .
