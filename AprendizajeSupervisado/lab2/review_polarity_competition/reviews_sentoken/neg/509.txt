The four movies included in this set -- 'Disorder In The Court ' , 'Malice In The Palace ' , 'Sing A Song Of Six Pants ' and 'Brideless Groom ' -- are in the public domain , which means anyone with recording equipment and a copy of the movie can release their own video . Frequently , the results are of poor video/audio quality ( although the movies themselves are quite good -- 'Brideless Groom ' is one of the funniest Stooge comedies ever ) . Columbia has just released an 'official ' Stooges DVD ( with six of the films on one disc ) -- hopefully the first of many . Stick with Columbia , and avoid these cheap knock-offs .
