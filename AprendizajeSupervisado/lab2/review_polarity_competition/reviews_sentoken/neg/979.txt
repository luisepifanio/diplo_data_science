I was mildly entertained with this movie until it got to the part where the bad guy authorized a US Fighter Pilot to engage an attack on a Semi driven by our real American Hero , John McClane , on a busy Mix Master Highway . `` Must kill that terrorist '' , RIGHT . So the Fighter Pilot is shooting missile after missile at Poor ole ' John collapsing overpass after overpass killing hundreds of motorists . `` Must kill that terrorist at all cost '' . That 's still not enough . He pelts it with bullets , destroying even more of the overpass . So when the Jet becomes disabled , the pilot ejects allowing his jet to crash causing even more destruction . It angers me anytime our military are portrayed as stupid or a bunch of hillbillies . That 's all I have to say about that .
