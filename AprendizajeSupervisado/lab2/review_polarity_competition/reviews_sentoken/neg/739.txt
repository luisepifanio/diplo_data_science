McLintock is a great comedy/western ; the casting is perfect and the script intelligent and witty . However , Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and cheated buyers of this DVD badly . The ancient Greek saying of & quot ; caveat emptor & quot ; or & quot ; let the buyer beware & quot ; fits well here.Anytime you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I highly recommend that you pass purchasing that item . Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released by John Wayne 's estate soon . This movie was not one of John Wayne 's favorites and was released late for being such a good movie . Hopefully this had nothing to do with the estate of Mr. Wayne in releasing a crisp ( and letter box ) version .
