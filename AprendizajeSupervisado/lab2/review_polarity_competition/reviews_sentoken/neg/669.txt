While the content of this DVD might be good , the presentation is simply miserable and I ca n't believe this was even released.It is basically a video tape put on DVD with random chapter stops that do n't even correspond to the songs.Someone could have spent an extra 10 minutes on this and made it a good DVD.Until they fix the shoddy job they did making this disc , do n't buy it.In addition , the two puppet remixes are just simply creepy .
