I 'm slowly going deaf at 44 , so I 'm looking into many different medias for self teaching . I was excited about this dvd , but when I started it I was appalled that there were no captions . I do n't know enough sign language nor can I hear well enough to get anything from this . So - if you can not hear , do n't bother getting this dvd !
