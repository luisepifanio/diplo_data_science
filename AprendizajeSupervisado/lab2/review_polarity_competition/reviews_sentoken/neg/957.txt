The information was facinating , but putting so much time and effort into psychedelics ( as a time filler ) got extreemly annoying . Being told about events and saying `` I have video '' several times , but being shown animations instead was also annoying . The subject matter was amazing and I actually do believe him , but I was hoping for an actual documentary .
