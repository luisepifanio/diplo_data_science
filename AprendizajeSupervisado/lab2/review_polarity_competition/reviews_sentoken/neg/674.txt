After reading the wonderful book `` Doc '' for book club , my husband and I watched `` Tombstone '' a few days ago , and `` Wyatt Earp '' last night , in preparation for next week 's book club meeting . To all those who say there is some controversy about which movie is better , I can put the controversy to rest : `` Tombstone '' is better.Watching `` Wyatt Earp '' felt like watching creaky community theater ( no offense to community theater ) from the opening scenes with Wyatt ( Kevin Costner , with his trademark anachronistic shag/mullet hairdo ) drinking a cup of coffee that is steaming like a witch 's cauldron , as if the stagehands just put a lump of dry ice in the cup . With the exception of the fine Gene Hackman as the Earp father , the male leads ' acting is either goofy cartoonish , or melodramatic , or wooden , or amazingly , all three at the same time . Having just watched Kurt Russell 's tightly controlled and uber-masculine portrayal of Wyatt Earp in `` Tombstone , '' Kevin Costner 's take on the same character reminded me a little of Forrest Gump , no offense to Forrest Gump , crossed with Costner 's character from `` Dances With Wolves '' ( same hairdo ) .I love Dennis Quaid , but having watched Val Kilmer 's definitive portrayal of Doc Holliday in `` Tombstone '' just a few days before seeing Quaid 's version in `` Wyatt Earp '' was probably completely unfair to Dennis Quaid and his cool little sunglasses , who just did n't even come close for me.I LOVE Westerns , but this cliche ridden movie -- tight shot of bottle right before a bullet explodes it , anyone ? -- made me roll my eyes . To sweeten the deal , it is over three hours long ! Recommendation : Watch `` Tombstone '' instead .
