Poor Bellini ! Out of fashion for a century and rescued from near obscurity by thegenius of Maria Callas only to be trashed by this horror . What are we to make of Zimmerman 's absurd production ? Bellini in some sort of big-city office loft , the characters , the action at total odds with the romantic bel canto score , the opera reduced to near farce . It might have been saved by superior singing but even that 's missing . It 's almost as though the singers were wondering to themselves : `` What the hell is this nonsense and why are we here ! `` Every operatic performance should be a tribute to the composer but in this case it 's nothing more than an obeisance to the director and her obvious need to be seen asdaring , outrageous , and inventive . One can only shudder to think what she has in store for future opera performance ( if any ) . Can we look forward to her Norma set in Detroit , a metaphor for inner city collapse ? I would n't be surprised .
