With better direction and acting , I think *Foxy Brown* could have been an awesome film . As it stands , it 's pretty much just a decent plot filled with distractions caused by a parade of terrible acting and outrageous '70s fashion ( the latter of which , however , is really almost reason enough to see the film ) .Pam Grier , despite her great sassy attitude and onscreen confidence , seems plagued by terrible delivery of her lines . ( There are zero successes , but several attempts at delivering some decent one-liners . ) Fortunately , however , Grier 's inablility at delivery is overshadowed by the awful acting of Katheryn Loder , who might just have given one of the worst performances I 've ever seen by an actress . None of the cast , however , seems particularly talented , with the best being Juanita Brown as the callgirl Claudia and Antonio Fargas as Foxy 's perfectly inept , hoodlum brother , Link.It 's still a decent flick , though maybe not one you want to put too highly on your `` must see '' list . If the fashion does n't draw you in , it 's worth seeing for Grier 's great action scenes and the often laughable and seemingly endless amount of random sexual situations to be found here . If you 're a fan of '70s chic , Pam Grier , or Blaxploitation films , it 's a definite must . Otherwise , rent it if you like a lot of violence and ca n't find any Tarantino films .
