I do n't deny that this series is entertaining , especially for VERY young children . My little one is 11 months , and when I put on any of the preschool prep series , he enjoys it . However ... ..how am I supposed to teach him `` G '' when I ca n't figure out myself what the animation is doing ? Goggles ? Gripping ? Grabbing ? Glasses ? And `` E '' is such a stretch Earring ? Elegant ? ? ? ? ? ? Not to mention `` O '' - my husband and I still look at it and go `` hmmmph ? '' I want my son to be imaginative while learning , but this is a bit off base . What happened to good ol ' elephant or egg for E and grass or giraffe for G ? A big mistake on Preschool Prep 's part I believe .
