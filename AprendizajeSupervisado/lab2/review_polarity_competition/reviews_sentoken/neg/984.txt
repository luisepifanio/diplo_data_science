I was disappointed with this DVD . I have a dance background and was able to pick up fairly quickly all the routines . Those without a dance background are up for a big challenge ( but it 's doable if you are diligent and patient with yourself ) . Make sure you have a large space to do this - Wo n't really work for condo living if you have neighbors below you and you 're jumping up and down . My other criticism is that during the cardio warm-up , Tracy changes what she 's doing and does n't verbalize enough what she is doing . For example , you are stretching your hamstrings with your head hanging down ( so you ca n't look at the tv ) , you 're in that pose for awhile , then you glance up and Tracy 's doing something else ... What the ? ? ? She did n't even say she was moving on . I just feel she is not very good with details . I noticed this in her Mat DVD , too ( very frustrating in that DVD ) . Also , I do n't think she 's very motivating or enthusiastic . She is pretty introverted to be doing these DVDs . I was thinking she might be like Jillian from The Biggest Loser ... Maybe I 'll check out Jillian 's DVD Shred next . I sold both my Tracy Anderson DVDs on eBay last and got my full price back .
