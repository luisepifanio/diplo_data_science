When I think Disney , I think about leaving the real world for 90 minutes . A departure from the grind of daily life . That includes comedy and light-hearted Disney animation . Ever seen Toy Story ? Ok , Dinosaur is 90 minutes of dino-despair . Every turn brings more death and depression . Yeah , there 's a happy ending , but did I even want to get there ? Of course , the animation and scenes were very beautiful - but this was a departure from what people know of Disney . I was disappointed with this one .
