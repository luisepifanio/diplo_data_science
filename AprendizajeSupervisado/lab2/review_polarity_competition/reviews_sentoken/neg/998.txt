OK , I read the book back in middle school and fell in love with it ! I must have read is several times . I recommend it to all my friends . When years later I heard they where making a movie out of it I was so excited ! I literally was jumping up and down . I could n't wait to see a new werewolf movie and from my favorite book no less . I thought this will be great it would the # 1 at the box office ! So I dragged my friends to see it on the opening date.Fist thing I noticed was that for an opening date the theater was not very crowded . I thought `` oh , well maybe people did n't understand the title . '' Less than half way threw the movie my mouth just hung open in disbelief ! It was an ABOMINATION ! They where butchering the it with their cheeze misinterpretation of the book and using horrible effects ! They did n't go from human straight into wolves in the flash of a bright effects light ! And I almost cried when I saw the ending ! It was complete opposite of the book ! What at the hell he used a silver butter knife to stab her ! ! ! ! This whole movie missed the torment , feelings and stuggle Vivian was going through in the end of the book . I highly suggest for people that have watched this movie to go read the BOOK ! I wanted to walk out of the theater so many times if it was n't for my friends . I cursed the whole time I watched this horrid film ! It made my favorite book so corny and fake it was horrifying ! If there where a lower rating then 1 star I would have put it ! I really hope someone else comes a long and makes this book into the movie it could have been ! Hell it could have been just as good as Twilight or better if they had followed the BOOK !
