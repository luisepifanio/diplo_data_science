Not very challenging ! I bought this video when I first began working out but never really followed through . Later I began doing alot of Denise Austin video 's , including her Yoga workouts . They were great and as I progressed I thought maybe I was ready to try Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss . I felt it would be more challenging since the Yoga instructor seemed to & quot ; specialize & quot ; in Yoga and Denise Austin does several different types of work outs . Boy was I mistaken . This video does not offer a very big variety of poses , and the poses it does have are not that challenging . There is mostly stretching and breathing . I would say this video is great for relaxation but since when does that add up to fat burning or weight loss ?
