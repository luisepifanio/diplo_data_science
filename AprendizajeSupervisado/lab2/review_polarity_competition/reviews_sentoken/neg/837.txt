This is a very 70s horror flick based on the bestselling book of the 'true ' story of a haunted Long Island home . It was debunked and proven to be a total sham , but the film spawned about ten sequels and even that necessary remake.The Lutz family purchases their dream house only to find that it 's haunted , and also helpfully contains the passageway to Hell in the basement . Yes , it is completely and utterly crushing to think that if such a passage existed into something called Hell , it would be in Amityville , Long Island.James Brolin plays the husband , tough guy with a lot of hair . Margot Kidder is the wife , who gets to react with big , wide eyes whenever she witnesses a ghost , hallucination , atrocity , etc . Most of the scares are indeed opening doors or something , looking at something , and then the music gets really loud , and then we see the peoples ' eyes , closer , and then , da-da ! A cheesy special effect.Good for nostalgia value . The appearance of Rod Steiger as a crazed priest is a major plus . Like a cheap Exorcist . If these types of films scare you , it might be worth it on a slow night . Good for some unintentional laughs , too .
