I decided to buy this product new to avoid scratches and other complications . Nevertheless , every single disc I have watched so far is scratched or covered in glue . Not one disc has been able to play properly . But how do you return a DVD once you 've opened the plastic packaging ? ? Either no standards have gone into making this DVD or I got a used DVD that was re-wrapped . I am not very impressed.While the show itself is awesome and incredibly addictive , the format makes it frustrating to watch . If I could go back , I would not have bought this DVD . I 'd rather buy a PVR and record re-runs .
