This documentary is total BS . The facts and opinions are totally wrong . I doubt that whoever was responsible for this have even read a single book on Gettysburg.Heth 's troops opened the battle , not Early's.Little Roundtop was the most important battle feature on the second day , not Culp 's hill.Custer did not `` Save the Union '' . Indeed Grant 's victory in Vicksburg did more to end the Civil War than the battle at Gettysburg . Had Meade lost there he would have retreated into Washington 's inpenetrable defenses and waited for Grant 's army to push Lee away from the district.I have read in many books about Gettysburg that Lincoln was livid that Meade did not follow up the battle by persuing Lee . Their statements as to a 'discovery ' of a hand written telegram regarding this and subsequent opinions was absurd.Indeed these four `` facts '' are only the beginning.Even the material regarding the address was silly.Avoid this garbage .
