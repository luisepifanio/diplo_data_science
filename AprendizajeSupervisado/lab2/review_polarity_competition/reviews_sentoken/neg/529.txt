A terrorist organistion hijacked a few nukes , and now terrorises the known world . Sound familiar ? Well , there 's a few things that make THIS movie set out . THESE terrorists all act like crap . In fact , the 'hero ' ( A dismissed navy seal with the charisma of a roadkill skunk ) has you wishing the terrorists would kill him already.Why 'd I buy this movie ? Simple . Leslie Nielsen was pictured on the cover ( the Dutch version at least ) . Being a fan of him , and hoping to come across an older movie in which his acting skills still were appreciated , I picked it up.Yes , he does well . No , he 's not in the movie for longer than 5 minutes . I 'm a huge movie fan , but this has me feeling I wasted an hour and a half of my life.Step around this one .
