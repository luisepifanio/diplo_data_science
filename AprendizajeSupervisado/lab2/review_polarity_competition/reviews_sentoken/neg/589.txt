After purchasing every available copy of this film on the market , please take my advise -- DO NOT BOTHER ! There is obviously no decent print of this film currently available . Being that it was originally produced by Samuel Goldwyn and released through United Artists , one might assume that MGM/UA Home Video might hold the original negatives ( since they appear to have the rights to other Goldwyn films presently ) . The truth may be that no better version of this film exists , and that would be a damn shame given its historic significance and the place it held in Soviet/US relations at the time it was made.But until MGM Home Video releases this title ( IF they ever do ) , save your bucks and download it for free off of the Internet . The quality ca n't be any worse .
