Violet is a hemophage - a woman who 's been infected with a virus that has made her and a few others vampires.The society at large wants them all dead . They construct a weapon played by Cameron Bright . Cameron 's just a kid , but with a deadly secret.Cameron 's also a kid who has limited expressions - playing the same creepy emotionless type he played in `` Birth '' ( against Nicole Kidman ) This film 's storyline is confused but plays out much the same as ( the more entertaining ) Aeon Flux - futuristic society run by oppressive oligarchy ; female warrior able to kill thousands through trick cartwheels and fancy weapons.I still gave this two stars because the special effects are great .
