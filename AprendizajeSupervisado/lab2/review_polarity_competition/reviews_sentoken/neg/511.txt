For some reason , the second Monogram Chan movie is a bit slow moving during the first half of the film . Mantan Moreland 's comedy material is not very good this time , but would improve in The Scarlet Clue and The Shanghai Cobra . Chan and Number 3 son Tommy get captured and roughed up this time , unusual in a Chan film . I would call this a middling effort from Monogram . Classic Chan line is & quot ; Expert is merely man who make quick decision -- and is sometimes right. & quot ;
