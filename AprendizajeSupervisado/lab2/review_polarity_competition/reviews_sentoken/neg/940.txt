... but a terrible DVD . The sound is plain old Dolby Surround and the movie is in fullscreen . I find this very annoying.I have always like Joshua Tree and looked forward to it 's DVD release . I imagined widescreen , Dolby 5.1 , trailers , commentaries and motion menus . But none of that ever happened . Artisan disappointed me SO MUCH with this poor and unimaginative release.I would like to start a campaign to get Artisan to change their minds . To get them to re-release this awesome film in widescreen . They must do this as this film totally rocks . Even the current cover art is painfully awful . A moody picture of a Joshua Tree would be better.One last thing . Amazon and the back of the DVD state that the running time is 102 minutes when it is actually the unrated 106 version . This version must remain intact in the future widescreen release .
