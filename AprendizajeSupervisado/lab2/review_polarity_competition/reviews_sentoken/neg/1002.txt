I am a huge fan of Christmas shows , new and old . I bought this expecting some great `` vintage '' performances . There were a few good ones , but many were actually cut off . A few were also just shown in a quick snippet . I was seriously shocked when the end came . I felt a bit cheated . There had to have been tons of performances that could 've been included . Just disappointed .
