This old TV special is made up from 10 cartoons , using only about 3 minutes of that cartoon . It would have gotten 5 stars if the cartoons were complete.For some unexplained reason the Easter Bunny calls Granny to tell her that he is sick & unable to distribute Easter Eggs . Granny thinks Bugs Bunny would be a good substitute , so she goes down to the Warner Brothers Studio where Bugs is filming 3 minute segments to complete his cartoons . Here she must sit through the various filmings & screenings of Looney Tunes Cartoon segments to try to talk to Bugs.The new animation is pretty poor & Mel 's vocal work is weak ( well he is older ) . It is hard to realize that this poor material was produced & directed by veteran Looney Toonists FRIZ FRELENG & BOB McKIMSON.Oh , and since this was for the kiddies , all gunshots by Elmer Fudd have been edited out of the TV Special . ( NOT by Warner for the DVD . ) Cartoon clips used from:1 ) Knighty Knight Bugs2 ) Hillbilly Hare3 ) Bully for Bugs4 ) Tweety 's Circus ( Tweety & Sylvester ) 5 ) Birds Anonymous ( Tweety & Sylvester ) 6 ) For Scent-Imental Reasons ( Pepe Le Pew ) 7 ) Rabbit Of Seville8 ) Foghorn Leghorn cartoon9 ) Robin Hood Daffy ( Daffy & Porky ) *almost complete , only the ending has been removed to segway back to the new animation . *10 ) Sahara HareBONUS COMPLETE CARTOON : HIS HARE RAISING TALE - basically a clip-show cartoon in which Bugs tells his nephew about his various adventures in 8 minutes , this means very short clips.So unless you want to collect everything Looney Tunes , wait for this April 's real Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck cartoon collections to come out with complete cartoons.Bugs Bunny : Hare Extraordinaire ( Looney Tunes Super Stars ) Daffy Duck : Frustrated Fowl ( Looney Tunes Super Stars ) On a positive note : June Foray gets screen credit for voicing Granny , something she was usually overlooked for in the voice credits ( but we knew it was her ) .
