I was very disappointed with how far this movie strays from the actual story ! It is `` roughly '' Prince Caspian but is lacking a lot of major elements.Number one , they left out Aslan almost entirely until the very end . Those who are familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the story 's strength and development . It was he who called the children into Narnia for his purpose an plan . Half of the book is about Aslan and the children , so the fact that they left his importance out of the movie really ruins the story.No Aslan , no Narnia ! There are a number of other aspects that do not stick to the book , but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not strayed from the real `` Heart '' of the story.The other big disappointment for me was how they altered Peter 's character . His whole attitude changed . You never get a chance to warm up to him and in the end are almost glad that he will not be returning to Narnia . ( The same can be said for Susan . ) The story line seemed very weak , and the relationship that they tried to create between Caspian and Susan was totally unnecessary and I felt , helped a great deal in ruining the film as well.But if you are not interested in the faithfulness of the story , Andrew Adamson 's `` Prince Caspian '' is an action packed adventure with many wonderful visual , and special effects.However , I would highly recommend that you read the story . The book has so much more richness and purpose . I wish they had stuck to this story as well as they had the `` The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe '' .I hope that they will do better on `` The Voyage of the Dawn Treader '' . We will see ... ! These are just a few of my thoughts . Needless to say , I feel that they could have made this film a lot better .
