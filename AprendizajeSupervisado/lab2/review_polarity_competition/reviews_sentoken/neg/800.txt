I do n't know who the people are on this interview , even though they are labeled as `` entertainer '' . The Narrator sounds like he is reading a book report that half of it is filler . The few times we see Katy Perry speaking was taken from random TV interviews or was taken from vlogs . Somebody was looking to make a quick buck with a DVD with Katy Perry on the cover .
