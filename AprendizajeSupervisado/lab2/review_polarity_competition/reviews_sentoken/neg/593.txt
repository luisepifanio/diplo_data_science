This is infuriating : There are how many -- a half dozen -- `` different '' editions of `` Abyss '' ? Several are single-disk , and several are double-disk.But no matter which of the many one looks at , one finds the exact same reviews on all of them : single-disk , double-disk -- no difference.So how is one to determine which will meet one 's needs , thus which to buy , if there is no information provided that would help one do so ? One fact is certain : until Amazon gets its act together -- keep the reviews for separate versions and `` editions '' separate -- there will be instances , as with this one , that I wo n't buy that which is immersed in a swamp of unnecessary confusion .
