Being a huge vampire/horror fan and a fan of the Bloodrayne videogames , i decided to give this movie a whirl.All i can say is ouch.The action scenes are laughable . The actors move in slow motion like they have no coordination . Im guessing this is due to a low budget fight choreographer.And the blood ! This movie has got to have the fakest looking blood ive ever seen ... Tough im giving this movie two stars for its over the top violence . The decapitations and such are so exaggerated and 'funny ' looking that its beyond comical . Think of Kill Bill multiplied 20 times ... All in all this is a pretty 'bad ' movie from start to finish.Theres pretty much absolutely nothing in this that i would recommend .
