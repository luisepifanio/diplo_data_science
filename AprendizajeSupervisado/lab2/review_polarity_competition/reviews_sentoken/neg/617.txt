Let me start off by saying that I love & quot ; Oh My Goddess & quot ; and I was really looking forward to the series ' DVD release . It is very sweet , funny and easily one of the most charmingly romantic series I have seen . I am most happy to spend some time with Belldandy , Keichi , Skuld and Urd.That being said , I am shocked and disappointed to find that they split the series onto two DVDs , each for separate sale . The episodes are very short , totaling a little over an hour per DVD ( I believe it is 82 minutes for Vol . 1 , and 62 minutes for Vol . 2 ) . There are no extra features included . Yikes ! That 's a lot for two and a half hours of viewing . I find it hard to believe that Animego could not do more justice to this excellent series , or provide more value to their customers . The six-part & quot ; Moldiver & quot ; OAV managed to find it 's way onto one well-priced DVD . How disappointing that & quot ; Oh My Goddess & quot ; could not do the same . I am sad to say that this is an excellent series to rent ( but not to buy ) .
