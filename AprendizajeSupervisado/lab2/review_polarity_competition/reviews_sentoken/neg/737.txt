I was disappointed when this version came out that people were being negative about it without even purchasing it . I did n't heed their warning and purchased it anyway.We live in a great age . We can get complete seasons of television shows . We can get movies with hours of behind the scene footage that enhance the experience . With all of these great things , why would a company abridge a great work like this ? The six hour version was already abridged from the nine hour play . The nine hour play was abridged from a 5000 page book.I tried to watch this version but I felt like I was seeing a flashback episode of a TV series.We all have been awaiting a re-release of the six hour version . This is an insult to a great work .
