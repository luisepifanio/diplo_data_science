The Ruff Ryders have become street legends in multiple ways throughout Hip Hop culture and they have set a standard for quality in delivery of a product that is often rough & unapologetic in levels of hardcore . This documentary in that respect is a slight exception . The tape 's quality was - Gyarrbage . The main man in view-Wink 1100 is a skilled ryder no doubt , but not much is shown as far as tricks on this tape other than wheeleez , wheeleez , and yes more wheelez with a few ryders sitting on the handlebars , stopping the bikes with the nose down-butt up , and yes -more wheeleez . All of this for the glory of saying you can go for BLOCKS with wheelee on your mind . The commentary by Wink and the few comic book styled cahracter personas he has created for himself are funny but short . They are funny in a this is bizarre way and far too long . There are lots of scenes with repeated footage . It 's only an hour , but by the time you watch your 100th wheelee-you 're done-finished -and in the words of Wink-feeling like `` Gyarbage '' for buying this tape . My recommendation would be to wait for Biker Boyz to come out on DVD and simply keep going over the scenes in that film where the main character and his crew are letting the professional STUNT Doubles do tricks . There is nothing like that on this RR project and with all of the hype they put up-there should be . Maybe the RR guys should stop smoking greenery and sipping that oil so that they can focus on more than wheeleez ! -Seriously -RR has the flyest logo and support team with music , clothing , and movies to boot-so deliver more and invest in some quality editing and camera men . OUT .
