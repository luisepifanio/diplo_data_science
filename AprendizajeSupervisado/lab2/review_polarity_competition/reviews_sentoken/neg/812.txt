This is an oddity - a low-budget supernatural western with a pretty good cast , an an eye for wintry landscapes and , most remarkably , a genuinely spooky atmosphere . Unfortunately , the direction and editing are woeful , particularly in the earlier Civi War battle scenes , and after the long climb up Demon Mountain , there 's a real sense of anti-climax . The journey is not helped by this Synergy DVD version , which is technically risible , a dodgy video recording transferred to the digital medium with the usual high degree of sound and picture degradation . Making matters worse are the holes where 'bad ' language has been excised and , more damaging still , the blood and gore has been less than surgically removed , which may explain why this version runs for 90 minutes while the original print was 114 .
