A quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers from having too much star power . No matter how scruffy and wain the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look , she 's still Nicole Kidman . Her portrayal of a janitor really pushes the limits of `` suspension of disbelief '' with her delicate features and legs that go on forever.And Anthony Hopkins is also miscast as a Jewish professor with a hard knock , secret past . While he remains one of my favorite actors , he can not escape his `` Britishness '' which is even more unbelievable once you discover what his character 's past is ! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller 's absolutely astonishing turn as the teenage Anthony Hopkins.Ultimately , the film is worth seeing for Wentworth Miller alone . But the casting of two megawatt Hollywood actors hurts the believability of this film in the end .
