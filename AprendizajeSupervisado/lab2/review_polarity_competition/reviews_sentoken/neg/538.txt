This transfer is absolutely horrid . I have probably hundreds of 'budget ' dvds and this is absolutely the worst transfer that I have seen to date.To further amplify the first reviewer 's comments , the subtitles are not only hard to read but generally IMPOSSIBLE to read . The bottom line of the subtitles is nearly always unreadable.Stay away from this and look for a Hong Kong version instead . Beverly Wilshire transfers are always among the worst of the budget dvd 's .
