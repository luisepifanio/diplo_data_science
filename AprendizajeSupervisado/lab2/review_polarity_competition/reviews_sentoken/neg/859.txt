There was so much more to Babe 's life than this documentary shows..There is next to nothing about his relationship to Lou Gehrig , Miller Huggins , his wives , Father Tobias ( spelling may be off ) who changed his life , ,his barnstorming trips where his All Star teams played against some of the great black players of those days like Stachel Paige ... The first 20 minutes consist of a verbal tribute from some very old gentlemen ... it was tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun etc..that went on and on ... we did n't have to be told over and over that he was a great player ... About one fourth of the film is VERY interesting ... but generally a real disappointment
