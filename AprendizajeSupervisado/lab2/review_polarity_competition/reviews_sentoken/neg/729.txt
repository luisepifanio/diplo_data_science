It 's unforntunate that I wasted so much energy anticipating this turkey . If you happen to be a fan of B movies , then you 'll probably actually enjoy it . Thin plot , lame dialogue , and special effects they must have stolen from Monty Python ( cue the spraying blood and flying body parts ! ) . If ; however , you 're a fan of good fantasy films do n't waste your time or money ! I 've recently found out that they 're making a sequel ! Who are they kidding ! ! ! The first one barely paid for itself !
