I bought this DVD because I was impressed with Ghislaine Thesmar 's commentary in the `` Etoiles '' documentary on the Paris Opera Ballet but had never seen her dance . I 'm still not sure I have seen her dance , because there were no close-ups and the picture was , as another reviewer noted , fuzzy . The audio problems were not simply a matter of recording but also of the musical performance itself . The orchestra , band , or whatever provided the accompaniment was not identified -- for good reason . Rather than give this DVD five stars with a caveat about drawbacks , I think it is more accurate to give it two stars with the qualification that those interested in performances with `` historical value '' may rate it higher .
