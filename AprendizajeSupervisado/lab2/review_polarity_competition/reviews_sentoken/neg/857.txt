Raid on Entebbe is a tightly directed film that portrays one of Israel 's finest hours - it is a tense story of incredible danger , and heroic rescue . Unfortunately , the 2007 edition is like watching a 1960 's television set with terrible reception . Amazon should not sell this version at any price .
