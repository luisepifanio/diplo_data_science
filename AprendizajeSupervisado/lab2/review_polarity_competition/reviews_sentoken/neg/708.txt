I love Phantom of the Opera so much and the music is beautiful . So I just knew this was going to be awesome . Well it 's not , it 's pitiful , there is not one good song in it and the story line does n't fit with what happened in Phantom . I would not recommend this movie . Do n't waste your money or time . Sad to say it simply is not worth it .
