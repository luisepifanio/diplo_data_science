I ca n't believe Good Times Video actually released this DVD without doing any touch up whatsoever , nor even trying to get a better copy before making the DVD . Normally one of the funner John Wayne movies , a sort of western version of & quot ; The Taming of the Shrew , & quot ; it 's nearly impossible to enjoy watching any of it due to the poor quality of the DVD . From the opening credits to the closing credits , the image is full of scratches and holes . There are even several complete scenes which are out of focus and blurry . This was obviously an attempt by Good Times to make a quick buck off of John Wayne 's name . Let 's hope that at some point in the future someone gets the rights to this film , restores it , and cleans up the images so that the charm of this movie is n't lost to future generations . Save your money on this one and pickup & quot ; The Quiet Man & quot ; or & quot ; The Horse Soldiers & quot ; . At least those DVD 's are not hard on the eyes .
