I 'll admit it , the beginning of the movie was pretty good . It kept me interested , the acting was good , and so far the script was pretty good as well.But after a while , the movie just got completely predictable and the script became horrendous . Whatever beginnings of a plot line the writers had soon diminished and the ending was completely ridiculous . The movie was not satisfying in anyway ; it left me with an incomplete feeling . The only thing that was up to par , in my opinion , was the acting . The actors did a pretty great job with the not so great script they got.My advice is , save your money and buy another movie ( or rent or however else you may see it ) .
