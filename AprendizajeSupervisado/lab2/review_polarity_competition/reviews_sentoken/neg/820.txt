This animated version of Alexandre Dumas ' classic novel was disappointing for several reasons . 1 ) the complex plot does n't lend itself to a short animation and as a result the simplified story line offered in the tape is incoherent . Why was Cornelius imprisoned ? Was his godfather a good character or an evil one ? 2 ) The graphics are primitive and VERY scary . The eight year old girl who viewed it to the end ( she always does , no matter what ! ) was often distracted and her five year old brother was bored and left the room before the scary parts forced us to turn off the tape . 3 ) The attempts to make the story appealing to young children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story untecognizable to anyone who , like me , has read and enjoyed the book .
