This is an excellent German-language film ( with English subtitles ) . The attempt is accurately to show the waning days of the Third Reich through the eyes of Hitler 's young secretary Traudl Junge . Bruno Ganz ( a Swiss born actor ) does an excellent interpretation of the unravelling Hitler - not a parody - but a very realistic interpretation of the megalomaniac living in a dream world of phantom army divisions as the `` Thousand-Year '' Reich crumbles around him.I highly recommend for historical accuracy and for excellent acting .
