Early Hackman , REALLY early Melanie Griffith . Cohesive , provocative script that will stand you in good stead for repeated viewing . Interesting photography , particularly the underwater shots . With Hackman one expects excellent acting and you will not be disappointed in any of the cast . The nude scenes are beautifully done , not blatant and fall naturally into the storyline.Good , solid , well-done film . The director is to be complimented .
