This movie is n't what I would call a `` chick flick '' , but it is wonderful for Mothers and Daughters . This is a very sweet story of success if family and friends come together to support each other . It has some very purposeful messages , especially to young women , who allow their success in life to overcome who they really are . I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and bought it the first day it came out .
