In my review of the album Fallen I quoted Lemmy of Motorhead saying that the album was above and beyond the call of duty . The rest of the quote was that he felt they could n't do it live . Well I have to disagree with Mr Kilminster as having seen the 'World Domination ' tour on it 's Australian leg I have to say that the band sounded spot on . And this CD shows that they can actually fill up the sound mix just like on their breakthrough album.This is actually a bit of a no frills thing in terms of audio . The sound is fine , the band are tight which is interesting given the personnel dramas of the time . The crowd noise appears to have been phased in and out though that 's a fairly regular situation . The main difference between these tunes from Fallen and their live versions here is that the sound does sound a touch hollower.Really this is a cash in job on their fame . Putting out a live album when you 've got next to no back catalogue is a bit cheeky . It also serves to fill the gap between their albums - aforementioned personnel upheavals no doubt played their part . Not that filling in time between albums w/ live releases and curiosities is a new idea ( G'n'R Lies anyone ? ) .For fans of this band this is probably essential listening . The songs do sound good , the crowd is suitably adoring and they are a likeable project.Three stars for the strength of the songs and because it does n't feel like there has been massive overdubs.The fourth star for the extra DVD which shows the band putting in value . They did also sell the DVD separately for a while however . Make sure you get this version with the DVD already in it as it really is worthwhile viewing .
