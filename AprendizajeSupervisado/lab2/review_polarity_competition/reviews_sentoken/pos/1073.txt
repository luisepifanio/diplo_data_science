Fine funny film . Brando later bad-mouthed this movie but he seems to be having a great time spoofing his Vito Corleone character . Bruno Kirby and Matthew Broderick have never been better . We loved the Kimono dragon sequence but the dialogue is exceptionally clever and the film has a sweetness to it that is sadly absent from today 's & quot ; family & quot ; films . Bruno Kirby played opposite the Vito Corleone character ( Robert Deniro ) in Godfather II which is seen in Clark 's film studies class . Highly recommended for film-buffs in particular and anyone who 's every wanted to see Don Corleone walking a kimono dragon on a leash !
