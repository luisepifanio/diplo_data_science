Criterion 's release of Alfred Hitchcock 's Spellbound has a slight flaw . 74 minutes into the film we get a shot of J.B. ( Gregory Peck ) holding a razor blade , whilst hearing Brulov 's ( Michael Checkov 's ) line off screen 'Is that you Mr Brown ? 'We then cut to Brulov for his next line 'Oh I thought it was you . ' Simple , no ? Well , the Criterion DVD cuts away from the razor blade too soon , and thenhas the footage of Brulov mouthing his 2nd line , whilst overdubbing his ! st ! Then we get the 2nd line properly . In other words , the footage of Brulov 's line'Oh I thought it was you ' is spliced together twice ! ! So far I do n't know if the Criterion disc is the only version affected.If you do n't mind the glitch , then Criterion 's version of Spellbound is the version to collect ( great extras and picture quality ) . And if you can still find it somewhere ( since it 's now Out of Print ) do n't hesitate to buy it , it 's still a very good disc and those extras really make this DVD into a true collector 's item . Just do n't throw away that old VHS tape !
