OK ; let 's be clear on something . This is a work of fiction . It is well crafted , slick , and enticing in it 's message . But it is fiction . However , let 's also be clear on some other things . First , many of the points that are made here ARE true . Which ones ? Well , I 'll avoid spoilers but suffice it to say that people often ask me if I am an atheist . No , I say , I do not deny the possibility of a higher being . But I do deny the church . This story shows clearly how organized religion has routinely destroyed the best messages but corrupting them with greed , lust for power , and cruelty . Groups of men made human choices and wrote human words to describe a system that would keep them in power , and this story delves into that . It delves into the little known facts surrounding the so-called `` holy '' bible ... the idea that what we know as the bible today differed greatly from what it once was . And so on . I do not seek to destroy faith , neither does this story . What it DOES do is hopefully entice the viewer/reader to THINK for THEIRSELF.This is a fun , well-acted , well-photographed story from a well-written and enjoyable work of modern fiction . I hope that if nothing else , it creates THOUGHT about the topic , and maybe , just maybe , people will begin to see the formal religious institutions such as Christianity for what they are ...
