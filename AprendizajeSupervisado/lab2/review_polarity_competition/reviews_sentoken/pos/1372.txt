I 've only recently started working out on a regular basis . In the past I would start something and then get bored or simply dislike it . But this , along with Jillian 's 30-Day Shred and Yoga Meltdown workouts have changed my life . What I love about this one in particular is that it 's fun while very intense . The variety in each circuit keeps me from getting bored , and Jillian 's instruction and encouragement keep me going . A few months ago I was someone who could n't do a single `` real '' push-up , and now I can do full sets of one-legged push-ups ! I LOVE feeling strong in my body ! Jillian Michaels rocks ! !
