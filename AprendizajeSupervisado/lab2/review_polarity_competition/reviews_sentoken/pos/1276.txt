This is one of my favorite movies . It 's quality is typical of what I have come to expect of a Criterion reconstruction . Something along the lines of HDTV black and white . It 's that good . The story itself is situated at the begining of Russia 's Great Patriotic War ( WWII ) . The story covers every inch of human behaviour including happiness , love , sorrow , deceit , manipulation , and heroism against all odds . The last quarter of the movie is a stunning surprise , as it builds to an ending scene that is nothing less than a grand tribute to the best of what makes us human . Even hardcore war movie fans ( like me ) can expect blurred vision at the end of this film . Not sappy at all , this film will strike a chord with viewers of any country , and most generations . It is not a single view disk . I do n't even know if it has an English language soundtrack , as the tonality of the Russian soundtrack combined with the very well produced English subtitles offers a great connection to the film even for non Russian speaking people . Buy this disk , you wil enjoy it over and over .
