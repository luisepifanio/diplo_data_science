I first watched this movie when i was 8 and then watched it 50 or 60 times ... Now i 'm 29 and for 21 years i did n't watch a better one.I think it 's the best western and also the best John Wayne and the best Robert Mitchum film that ever made.The music is incredible and also the atmosphere and the action ... This is a must have western..It 's worth to buy ... Simply The Best ...
