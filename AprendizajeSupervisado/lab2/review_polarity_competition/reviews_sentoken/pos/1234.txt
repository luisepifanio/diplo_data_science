First off , I have to come clean . I first saw Full Metal Jacket in its original theatrical release . About all that stayed with me was the scene in the head that ends the second third of the film . I bought it at the recommendation of my son , a newly-commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Marines . He calls FMJ the `` Marine Movie . '' He also calls the time period `` one shameful chapter in Marine Corps history . '' The routine abuse of recruits depicted in the film no longer happens . Even so , the film gets it right on both counts . Marine training , even thirty years later , is as demanding as Kubrick depicts . It has the same goal : the creation of `` indestructible men ( and now , women ) '' who can kill as many of the enemy as possible . The experience of Marines in combat , especially in Vietnam , is as the film demonstrates . As he undergoes training that will qualify him to lead a platoon , I asked my son about the incident that leads to the second cold-blooded killing . Could it have happened that Marines would become so lost that they would be at the mercy of a sniper ? Absolutely , he replied , adding that Marines view the prospect of urban warfare with trepidation : `` There is an infinite number of places where the enemy could be . '' Further , he said , Cowboy made the right call , even though it resulted in the deaths of three Marines . Even though I was in the streets in a different way during Vietnam ( and could not have seen combat anyway -- I 'm blind in my right eye and right-handed ) , I am convinced that Semper Fi is for real . `` Semper Fi , do or die , gung ho , gung , ho , gung ho . '' The Marines are indeed the best we have , the inspiration for Army Rangers and Delta Force and Navy SEALS . They have raised the bar in ways that I did n't appreciate . Run , do n't walk , to see this movie .
