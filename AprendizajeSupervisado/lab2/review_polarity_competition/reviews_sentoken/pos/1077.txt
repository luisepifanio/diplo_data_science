This story caught my attention immediately and held it for the entire film . The movie is based on the life of John Nash . He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics.The film spans several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University . Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash . The part required the transformation of Nash from a young and healthy man to an aging schizophrenic . Alicia , Nash 's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly . She 's very convincing as an intelligent and strong woman who comes to realize that her brilliant husband is very troubled and lives in another world.One particular and lovely scene stands out in my mind where Nash and his future wife are looking at the stars . He tells her to think of different shapes or animals and he is able to look at the night sky , with its millions of stars , and link them together into whatever form she mentions . I wish there had been more scenes of that kind and maybe a little insight into Nash 's family and childhood.John Nash was eventually awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for Mathematics , which is some consolation , but the tragedy of his gifted mind being assaulted by delusions was something that I wo n't forget . I came away from this movie with a tremendous amount of compassion for John Nash . Schizophrenia is truly a horrible mental disease.This film is worth seeing and I believe that it will stand the test of time .
