This was a very interesting film . It is in fact NOT banned in Singapore . I saw this film while living there and it was quite a relief . Though the movie focuses on street hoodlums , the overall theme is the forgotten people of singapore who are not able to be doctors , lawyers or gahment ( government ) cronies . Students are streamlined at a very young age and a few bad tests mean your are lumped in with the dregs . This film shows what is happening in Singapore on a side that many sinagporeans are unaware of . 5 stars for boldness . The cinematography is tough ( choppy ) at parts and the story line jumps a bit ... but it is still very compelling .
