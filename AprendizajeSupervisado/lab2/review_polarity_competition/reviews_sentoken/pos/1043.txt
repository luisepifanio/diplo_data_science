[ [ ASIN : B001CTBGNS Zulu ( 1964 ) [ Blu-ray ] I had read The reviews on ZULU Bluray and was initially put of buying it , I then realized that these were very old reviews and not for The Bluray version . I have just screened it and was 'blown away ' Fantastic definition Great Colour and good sound , several interesting 'making of ' extras and original trailer . Highly Recommended.Ian Rough .
