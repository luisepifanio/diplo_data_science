This the ultimate 80 's dance movie , i love Flashdance and Footloose but nothing beats this little gem . It stars Lucinda Dickey ( best jazz dancer in the world ) , Shabba Doo ( best body popper in the world ) , and Boogaloo Shrimp ) the ultimate Breakdancer . A trio of dancers takes on the dance world by using a big time contest to make the big time on broadway . Some great performances by Ben Loky and Christopher McDonald and the dancing is totaly mind blowing . And who can forget the awesome hip hop soundtrack with Ollie & Jerry and Chaka Khan . Get this dvd now and expirience the best movie to come from the 1980 's .
