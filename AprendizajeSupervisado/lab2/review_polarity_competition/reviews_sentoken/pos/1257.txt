A witty , perceptive movie about a group of college friends and how they adjust to love , money , sex , the outside world , and brunches . The script is a throwback to screwball comedies where the characters were dimensional and the viewer cared about each character . The performances are flawless . Special mention to Maddie Corman and the delectable , hot , phenomenally talented Christian Maelen . The man is so delicious in every way humanly possible that he will charm the pants of both men and women . This movie is a real treat . An intelligent movie that does not rely upon gross out humor to involve the audience .
