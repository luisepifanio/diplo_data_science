I bought this DVD without having seen it in the theater or on video . I bought it on the basis of the strong reviews I saw on year-end top ten lists . This is one of the few ( only ? ) major animated works that does not double as a musical . It relies solely on the strength of its characters to tell the compelling story of young `` Hogarth '' ( yes , Hogarth ! ) who befriends a giant robot who has crash-landed on earth during the 1950s . Naturally , the military and other adults become suspicious of the apparently benign giant . The real strength of this film is that both adults and children will enjoy it because it works on several levels . It is a sly commentary on 1950s paranoia ( without being heavy-handed ) , an exciting adventure film , and a comedy that has humor for adults and kids . Both will fall in love with the `` Iron Giant '' ( voiced by Vin Diesal , from `` Saving Private Ryan '' ) who eventually teaches us humans a thing or two about loyalty and sacrifice . A word of warning for those with very small children : there are a few `` damns '' and `` hells '' ( 3 or 4 ) throughout the movie ; thus its PG rating .
