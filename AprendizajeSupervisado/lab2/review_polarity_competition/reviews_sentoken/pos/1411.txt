If you 're feeling in the mood for lighthearted romance , this is a good pick . No doubt it 's a `` chic flick '' -- I mean really , Sandra Bullock & Keanu Reeves . But one could easily lure/sucker her guy into watching it by saying that `` there 's stuff in it about time travel and it 's got that guy from The Matrix . '' Seriously , I enjoyed it -- it switches back and forth quite a bit so that keeps it from being completely mindless entertainment -- you actually have to pay attention to keep the time frame straight -- but it 's still a very solid choice for diversion from `` real life '' for a couple of hours .
