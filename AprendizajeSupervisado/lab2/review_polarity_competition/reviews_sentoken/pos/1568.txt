After the first installment in the Blade series , I was really looking forward to the sequel - and I was n't dissapointed . This far surpasses Blade and just hightens the suspense for Blade : Trinity ( out Dec 10 ) . Wesley Snipes is his usual great self in a fast-paced , suspense action movie . Kris Kristofferson is brilliant as Whistler once again ( as are the rest of the cast ) . If you liked the first then you will definetly like this - and hopefully like me you cant wait for Blade : Trinity !
