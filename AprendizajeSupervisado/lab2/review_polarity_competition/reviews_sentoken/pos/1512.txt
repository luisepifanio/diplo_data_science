I am a sucker for any movie or play that is historical , and this definetly fits the era in which women had few rights . Sometimes we need to look back on history to see how we have progressed from those times . Women have come a long way for their independence and the right to live their lives their way . I would suggest parents to let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man you would like to marry , not what was good for the family . Marriages were arranged and most marriages were only considered biblical room mates . Men have always had their mistress ' to turn to when his wife in unavailable ( pregnant ) and if they have been kicked out of their wives bed and considered to be in the dog house . The movie really portrayed how little control women had over their future.Now about the movie.. it is true history about this duchess and her life . I give thanks that someone out there put a real historical piece together like the duchess . I would recommend that everyone should see this film , and know just how blessed we are today to be able to make our own choices in life whether good or bad .
