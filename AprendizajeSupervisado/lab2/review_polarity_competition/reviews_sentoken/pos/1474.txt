Starting in the late 50 's , there was a string of country music movies made , perhaps in reaction to the successful string of B rock and roll movies from about the same time . Most of them featured some sort of plot involving rubes getting themselves into all kinds of trouble . But these movies were not just the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies ; they were the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies who had famous country music stars as friends . In other words , the flimsy plots and fading movie stars were just an excuse to showcase a slew of country music stars of the time . Many of the performances were lip-synched , although some were recorded live . The Nashville Sound , which was recorded in 1969 , was different . Perhaps influenced by the Pennebaker documentaries of the time , this film had no flimsy plot or corny gags . Instead , it was a serious look at Nashville and the reigning country stars of the day . It 's well filmed , thorough , and fascinating to watch . Much of it was filmed at the Grand Ole Opry , but you also get priceless footage such as Loretta Lynn performing for a lunch crowd of radio and record company people , Bashful Brother Oswald singing a chorus of Mountain Dew outside of Ernest Tubb 's Record Shop , a rehearsal by the new-to-town Mother Earth ( featuring Tracy Nelson ) , a performance outside Shelby Singleton 's house , a recording session featuring Doug Kershaw and a young , beardless Charlie Daniels , and lots more . There is also lots of great footage of Nashville itself . All the performances are outstanding , and the film does a terrific job of capturing the essence of country music at the time -- performers , fans , and industry people . I was waiting a long time for this to come out on DVD !
