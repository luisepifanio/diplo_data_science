Yes , Keanu Reeves actually plays the villain in this wonderful , magical movie of romance , jealousy , romance , betrayal and honor set in Renaissance Italy . Created by and starring Kenneth Branagh , this remake of one of Shakespeare 's comedies is probably the most enjoyable and entertaining movie based on one of the Bard 's plays . The cast includes many big names from both sides of the Atlantic such as Denzel Washington , Emma Thompson , and Michael Keaton , and the heroine is the first big outing for Kate Beckinsale . The dialogue in the movie stays true to the original play and the setting is probably as close as possible to what Shakespeare imagined . Best of all is the music ; classical in style but original in composition . I enjoyed watching this movie over and over and so will you .
