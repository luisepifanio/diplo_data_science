Armand Assante is a favorite of mine . I loved all of his movies . I was so suprised to see him in a doo-wap role , but he was fantastic as always . His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now dealing with the potential loss of his daughter from the same disease is heartwrenching . His relationship with his two sons also brings reality to a parent 's love for his children , and the torment of his past singing career . He and his singing group of the 50 's made one big hit , but were soon removed from the limelight . Over the next 30 years , he works as a bartender and his group plays for weddings . If you love doo-wap and Assante , you 'll love this movie . Nostalgia at its best . I recommend getting the Audio CD and playing it before seeing the movie , then you will really enjoy it .
