Well , Scary Movie 4 may have a chance , but 2 and 3 did nothing to come close to the hilarity that the first in the series brought ( other than the opening scene of 2 where James Woods tries to excersise the hell house ... hilarious ) This film is more on the lines of Scream and I Know What you did Last Summer and it has almost the identical plot , but what makes it so funny is that is shows you the stupidity in the overly serious tone these horror films take . Scary Movie makes fun of the typical Scary Movie , and it works ... I mean , look what it has to work with . Anna Farris is your heroine , and this is her movie ... the movie she was meant to star in . The Waynes brothers are also BIG reasons to watch this film , other than hottie Shannon Elizabeth ! With Marlyn playing the crack adict who gets high with the killer and Shawn playing the sexually confused jock they have the most memerable charactors in the film . The funniest scene is when they spoof The Blair WItch Project . Everyone was laughing so loud I had to watch it again by myself to hear what the chic was saying . With funny scene after funny scene Scary Movie should be at the top of your DVD pile because for some reason it never gets old .
