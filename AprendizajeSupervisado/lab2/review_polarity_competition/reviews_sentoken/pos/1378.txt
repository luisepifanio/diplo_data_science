Unlike most other reviewed films , the reviews for this film are actually pretty accurate . The film details the rise of stardom of three Ziegfeld girls ; Judy 's character rises to stardom , Hedy 's character retires to comfortable married life , while Lana 's character `` comes a cropper '' . The plot is overlong , and the Lamarr plot in particular is trite and uninteresting.It 's the numbers on one hand , and the Turner subplot on the other , that make this movie . The story of Lana 's rise and fall from stardom is the only one that 's worth viewing . This meaty role was the role that cinched Lana 's stardom . Moreover , the numbers are stellar . Some might say overproduced , but I say spectacular -- most particularly , the `` Out of a Dream '' number has the most glamorous costumes ever glimpsed on celluloid . I 've never seen so much feminine beauty in my life ; beauty floating down ethereal stairs , to ethereal music sung by Tony Martin . You 'll want to watch it again and again.Here are a few bloopers to watch for:1 . In the `` Minnie from Trinidad '' number , shortly after the mule is seen , you can see a male dancer walking off the set , in the background -- very much out of sync to the music . The first time I saw this , I could n't believe the editor had missed it.2 . Watch Judy VERY closely as she waltzes down the stairs in the `` Out of a Dream '' number ; you can see glimpses of nudity as she nears the bottom of the stairs ! 3 . In the `` Out of a Dream '' number , all the girls are smiling ... except for Hedy Lamarr . This contrast is jarring . Hedy Lamarr 's teeth were out-of-alignment in real life . She 's one actress who was far more beautiful when not smiling .
