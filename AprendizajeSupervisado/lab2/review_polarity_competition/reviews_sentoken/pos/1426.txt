Yes , I 'm using all the Interjections from SchoolHouse Rock to sing it 's praises . I grew up with Schoolhouse Rock , but to be honest I thought about it only when my husband and I laughed nostalgicly about memorable songs like Conjunction Junction . Then , he bought the 30th anniversary edition for our daughter ( he was trying to qualify for free shipping when he was buying the Tripletts of BelleVille ! ) . So , it can be said that neither of us anticipated how fantastic this DVD would be -- STILL ! My 3 year old LOVES it , and I ca n't say enough great things about the creative lyrics that teach grammar , numbers and how the body works ( maybe I should reach into my bag of adjectives , which my daughter charmlingly calls `` magictives '' ) . It is the one DVD we own that I do n't feel any apprehension about evil or scary characters , dark plots or questionable character influences ( which are startling present in many videos for preschoolers ) . If you 're wondering about getting this video , wonder no more . It is a timeless winner that wo n't disappoint ( unless you 're looking for dark plots and questionable character influences ! )
