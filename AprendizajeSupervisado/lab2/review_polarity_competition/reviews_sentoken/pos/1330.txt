First review ever ! ! I workout regularly 3-4 times weekly and interchange running/yoga/weights . My goal is always the best results with the least amount of time ! ! I have wasted so much money on exercise videos ( lastest being Yogalosophy : do n't buy it ) and Jillian Michaels is the best ! ! ! I loved her 30 day shred and love this one even more . It 's fast and effective . I saw results with just 3 sessions . I am female in my late 30 's . Of course you have to be sensible when it comes to eating ! ! Highly recommend this video ! !
