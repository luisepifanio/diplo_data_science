The cultural revolution that shook Paris 1905 to 1930 is well chronicled in this mesmerizing two-hour DVD documentary , which includes photographs , film archives , literary excerpts , and analyses . The focus in on the arts , from classical music and jazz to sculpture , from poetry to dance , from painted canvases to novels . The rise of Modernism from the post-Impressionists to Fauvism , to Cubism , to Dada and to Surrealism and their numerous beaux-arts and literary pioneers is seen as an extraordinary period of free experimentation and cross-disciplinary interactions , particularly between poets and artists . Paris was the fermenting pot and the avant-garde was strong , sharp , and manifold . Watching this documentary can induce envy . O to have lived in such a time ! Of course , I and many of my generation did indeed experience such a revolution , albeit of shorter duration in this accelerating society , when the San Francisco Bay Area circa 1965 to 1980 was the hub in musical , artistic , noetic , ecological and other scientific innovations and explorations . Which brings up a minor deficiency in the documentary : the absence of any mention of the developments in science , especially physics , and its influence on the arts , when concepts of time and space and matter were the subjects of radically new thinking . Otherwise , the survey is a wonderful cultural history , from the optimism of pre-WWI and the engine of cynicism and creative criticism following that carnage . The viewer can next plunge into the many books covering this exciting period for further study . This DVD is an excellent introduction in art history and cultural studies .
