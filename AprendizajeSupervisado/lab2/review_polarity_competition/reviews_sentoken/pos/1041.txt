I really like this practice . It is only 45 minutes long , has good modification choices , and I like Suzanne Deason 's instruction and voice . I began doing this DVD in January three times a week , weighing 224 lbs & had a little trouble , solved by practicing with the full modification option . Now , I can go along with Deason herself , & I rotate this out with the strength & flexiblity portions of the Yoga Conditioning for Athletes DVD ( also good ! ) , and Rodney Yee 's Power Burn . Plus , every morning I either do A.M Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss or the more gentle A.M Yoga , all from Gaiam . I just like Deason & Yee a lot . I 've never felt better .
