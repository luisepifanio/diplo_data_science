This is a masterpiece of a film by an inspired John Landis who takes a topic done dozens of times before -- lycanthropy -- and adds a little sauce and spice to the kettle . Here we have a werewolf film with adventure , black comedy , a little flesh [ both pressed together and ripped apart to bloody shreds ] , laughs , `` oh-my-Gods '' and even pathos . This is a great , imaginative , inventive film with superb special effects that you will never forget , as I have n't since I saw it on the screen in 81 . Starts off with a couple of young Americans backpacking it through the spooky European countryside at night . Love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcomed like the plague . Both leave the place and are quickly pounced upon by a werewolf with one guy getting mauled to death and the other , the 'he-shoulda-gone places ' David Naughton [ who plays David ] surviving only to become a murdering werewolf . All hell breaks loose thereafter , as David falls in love during the day , kills by night and constantly bumps into his 'back-from-the-dead ' backpack companion , Jack -- complete with mauled & ripped flesh . Great cringes and laughs as with each of Jack 's post-mortem apperances he is more and more deteriorated until , at the end , he is nothing but skull and fascia . The scene in the theatre when Jack introduces David to each of his deceased , devoured victims , complete with gaping holes and missing limbs , is a beaut . The transformation scene where David turns into a werewolf in his living room is absolutely ASTOUNDING and UNFORGETTABLE -- -this is an all-time classic horror scene . Cheers to the special effects and make-up pros here . GREAT film-making by John Landis with refreshing originality and a marvelous , astute variation on a sterotypic horror theme . Sorry Naughton did n't become the star he should have . If you have n't seen this one you MUST before the next full moon . Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys .
