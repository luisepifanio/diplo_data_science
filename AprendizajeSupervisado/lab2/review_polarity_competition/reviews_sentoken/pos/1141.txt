My expectation of this film was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of information I had gleaned from having seen the eye-opening film `` Fast Food Nation '' several years ago , and having just finished reading the excellent books `` Animal , Vegetable Miracle '' and `` In Defense of Food '' among others . However , this film is more than the sum of those books and that movie . Food Inc. is an extremely well made documentary in part because of the personal stories told by interviewees , as well as the hidden camera footage . I was especially impressed by what 's happening to farmers.The material is so well investigate and presented . Multiple aspects of food production , marketing and consumption are covered . There is no `` time out '' in this movie , it 's one hit after another . All shocking and important information we citizens need to be concerned about.Kudos to all involved in the making of this incredibly important film . Thank you to those who stuck their neck out to tell the truth.Yes it is disturbing , but you need to watch it .
