After only 2 days , I feel more flexible and strong . The music is so soothing and helps you to focus , and Suzanne is a great instructor . So many yoga instructors are really annoying , she is not.Too soon to tell if it will help me to lose weight , but already I am turning away from junk food ... as if it will poison my body . I will continue to do this tape until it becomes too easy , since I think I am getting a great workout .
