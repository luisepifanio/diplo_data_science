British Army engineers came to a mission to build a bridge and ended up fighting a three day war.This movie is an icon of the 1960s . Clear , crisp colors . Red Brit . uniformed Tommies face off against the spear and shield lugging Zulus . Neither side will give.Just from a cinematic experience alone one should watch this film . Some people might be squeamish about the death and carnage , but it is a fascinating slice of human drama.All actors turn in marvelous performances , and I think this is one of Michael Caine 's best.Also , the John Barry score is the best non-James Bond score he did.All around a good Friday night or Saturday afternoon movie .
