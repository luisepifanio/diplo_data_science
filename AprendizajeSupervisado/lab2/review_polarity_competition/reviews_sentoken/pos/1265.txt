This movie is about a million times better than the recent remake `` Red Dragon . '' The real conflict of the film is Will 's ( William Petersen ) tenuous grasp on his sanity as he tracks a killer who is about to strike while dealing with a killer who he has already caught . While Brian Cox 's Lecktor will draw comparisons to Anthony Hopkin 's version in subsequent movies , Cox plays the psychopath as a real threat -- a murderer who will kill . Hopkins is brilliant as well , but I always felt that his Lector was like an animal who would strike only of thouroughly provoked . We see Cox and Petersen as equals on different sides of the fence , with little separating them other than Petersen 's Graham 's knowledge of right and wrong . This thriller is one of the best .
