Paul Newman is one of the best actors of the twentieth century , his range alone will show you that . His movie , Fat Man and Little Boy ; gave me far more understanding about the second world war and the people involved in it including the reasons and ramifications of Dr. Oppenheimer 's work . I recommend it as highly as I possibly can . No matter what Paul Newman film you buy , you can not find a finer actor . Thanks !
