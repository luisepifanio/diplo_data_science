I 've never been able to slog through any of Chomsky 's books , but this documentary is completely accessible . He has some great insights into how the media really works , and what that means for our society.I 've seen this movie several times , and it is still just as relevant as when it first came out . If anything , the issues Chomsky addresses have become more urgent today .
