This film was a great teaching tool for my college students learning about conflict and how to transform it . Water is already a conflict in the Middle East , but it wo n't be long before we see this conflict rearing it 's ugly head on all continents . We have the tools and expertise to prepare and prevent water conflicts , and this movie allows us to see this in advance so we can act on it .
