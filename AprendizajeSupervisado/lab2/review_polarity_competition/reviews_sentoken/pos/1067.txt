Black Sheep ( no , not the Chris Farley and David Spade starring movie from the mid-90 's ) is a movie that has to be seen to be believed . Taking place in New Zealand as a sheep-phobic man ( Nathan Meister ) returns to his old family farm to make peace with his brother ( Peter Feeney ) who just so happens to be genetically altering the sheep that populate the land . These sheep end up with a hunger for human flesh , and those they bite turn into monstrous were-sheep ( yes , were-sheep ) , and before you know it , they 're running amok . Yes , Black Sheep sounds absolutely ridiculous , and by all means it is , but the film is so enjoyable that you ca n't help but admire it . Not to mention the brilliant gore and creature effects courtesy of Peter Jackson 's own WETA workshop team , as rookie writer/director Jonathan King throws one visual gag right at you after another upon heapings of gore . It does n't come close to the irreverent horror/fun of Shaun of the Dead per se ' , but for what it 's worth , Black Sheep is bloody good fun that fans of comedic horror should definitely check out .
