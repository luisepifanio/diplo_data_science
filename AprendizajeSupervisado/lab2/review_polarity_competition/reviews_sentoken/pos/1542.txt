`` L'Affaire du Collier '' may be based upon a true story , but it is also an enthralling historical romance , `` The Queen 's Necklace , '' by Alexandre Dumas , who certainly had more than the `` Three Musketeers '' up his sleeve . Dumas relates the identical story of Joseph Balsamo ( aka Count Cagliostro ) , Jeanne de la Motte Valois , the lecherous but charming Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond scam , although the movie makers give Dumas no credit whatsoever ( I note that the book is available on Amazon.com , and I highly recommend it ! ) .The costume designer , Malena Canonero , deserves plaudits for the swathes of silks , satins , and lace jabots that recreate the opulence of the 18th-century court of Louis XVI magnificently . The settings are also splendid . I found much of the music jarring , however , in that the composer insisted on giving it a modern beat at times , and also used a mish-mash of Mozart 's `` Requiem , '' among other things . I find such cuts and rearrangement of a bar here ; a bar there , to be both lazy and a bit of a cheat . In the featurette , the director explained that he wanted to make the period `` accessible '' to modern audiences . Such `` accessibility '' not only insults the intelligence of the modern audience but also weakens the movie.Because the story is so strong , I nevertheless enjoyed the film . I was particularly impressed with the performances of Jonathan Pryce as the suave Cardinal , Adrien Brody as Jeanne 's feckless husband , and Simon Baker , who is especially engaging as her love interest . All of them are believable and move well in their silks . Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress , I thought she was miscast in this role . She looks a trifle uncomfortable in her costume and moves more like a woman of the twenty-first century rather than one of the eighteenth.These reservations aside , I shall keep this film and doubtless watch it again .
