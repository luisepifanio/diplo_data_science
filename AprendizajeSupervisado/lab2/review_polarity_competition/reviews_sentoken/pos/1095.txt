About the only thing wrong with this picture is the title . Adapted from Thomas Harris ' novel `` Red Dragon '' , a decision was made to change the title . Probably thinking most American film goers would think it 's a Kung Fu movie or something . Probably right . This is also before the more acclaimed sequel `` The Silence of the Lambs '' by the same author . It is another great film by Michael Mann oozing with both style and substance . The style may bother some people . It is shot with various unnatural hues including violet , blue and green . While they are perhaps not realistic they always seem to fit the scene . Mann and his photographer place cameras in interesting places . Take for example the Hannibal Lector 's ( Brian Cox ) stark white cell . We see both Lector and Will Graham ( William Petersen ) centered between the same 2 bars , with quick cuts back and forth . Another camera hovers above the room . This movie is n't really about Dr. Lector however . It is about a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy ( Thomas Noonan - really creepy ) . As Petersen struggles with his own sanity he homes in on the killer using his ability to get inside the killer 's head . He stole this theme for his `` Miami Vice '' TV series about this same time . Another great tactic Mann is known for is the use of music . Here we get an original score by The Reds and Michel Rubini , not to mention the unbelievably cool climatic scene featuring Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida .
