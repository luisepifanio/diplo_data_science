Every year my daughter and I have a special `` tradition '' to go out in the Fall and buy the new Barbie DVD the day it comes out . We mark the day on our calendar and make it really special . Lately we have bought others that come out throught the year ( we also loved the Barbie Diaries ) . We have every Barbie movie and I love them as much as she does . This latest one ( which I just go finished watching ) was wonderful . It was as magical as Rapunzel which was my prior favorite . Go out and buy it !
