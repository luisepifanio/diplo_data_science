The Bunny Works has REALLY came a LONG way ever since the last animated film and a very medicore one , & quot ; King and I & quot ; . Now this dazzling new movie finally comes up with wonderful , well-developed characters , very professional animation , lots of fast-paced action that no eye can ever follow , simply GORGEOUS art graphics , and a very stern message regarding xenophobia and the need to respect life . It takes place in late 1950s , when America was still gripped in its fears of a cold war , a young boy stays alone at home watching cheesy sci-fi movies while his pretty young mother worked late into night at the local diner . Then he hears some funny noises , so he goes investigating and thus runs smack into the most unlikely friend he would ever make : a towering robot who could gobble up cars and flatten entire forest areas . Yet this mechanical monster turns to be a very gentle creature who is quite full of innocence and love . And along comes a sharp-nosed detective who is sniffing suspiciously for any clues to the strange happenings in the small Maine town . Poor Hogarth ( what a name ! ) has to fight feverishly to protect the great stranger who doubtlessly feels quite unwelcome here on this planet . A great work of art that will win the respect of the collective audience who had been unfortunately conditioned to consider animation as sugar-coated fare for tiny tots . But - this medium can be a very powerful storyteller as a truly sweeping proof like & quot ; The Iron Giant & quot ; will definitely prove !
