Louis Malle 's Lacombe , Lucien still impresses , although it does tend to amble in the third act just when you might expect it to tighten its grip . But it 's still a casually powerful reminder of the less heroic side of France under Vichy rule ( the Nazis are barely seen in the film ) as its none too bright farmboy just drifts almost accidentally into collaboration with the German Police made up entirely of his compatriots after being turned down for the Resistance . The film 's major achievement is in showing , much like fascism in general , the appeal that collaboration had to the disaffected and the underachieving outsiders in the community ( only one of the ` police ' is a real zealot ) and the attraction of undeserved and unearned power as Lucien finds the power he has over people ( particularly the unspoken threat of handing his Jewish ` girlfriend ' - perhaps a little over symbolically called ` France ' - to the Germans ) is far more intoxicating than killing mere animals.Throughout , as with Melville 's resistance masterpiece L'Armee des Ombres , there 's a mundane sense of reality that heightens the drama . Set in the kind of small picturesque village that outsiders find idyllic but which is a tedious hell to live in for the locals , it shows how malaise and opportunity is far more of a driving force than malice . Certainly it 's far from glamorous , its collaborators hanging round in a local hotel getting drunk and bemoaning their lot as the war news gets continually worse ( as one points out , you have to listen to both the German and the British radio reports `` and split the difference '' to find the truth ) and they gradually get picked off by the emboldened locals.The only extra on Criterion 's disc is the imaginative theatrical trailer , so this might be worth picking up in Criterion 's boxed set which also includes Au Revoir Les Enfants , Murmur of the Heart and an exclusive disc of extras mainly focussing on Louis Malle rather than the films themselves .
