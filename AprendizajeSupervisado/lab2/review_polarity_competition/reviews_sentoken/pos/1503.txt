MAD MAX 2 : THE ROAD WARRIOR has to be one of the most intense action films ever produced . There 's very little I might add to this already popular movie . Both fans and critics are unanimous in their praise for what is the BEST chapter of the MAD MAX trilogy . Having this said , it 's also EXTREMELY sad to see the kind of DVD treatment this highly innovative film has received . Unlike the special edition of the MAD MAX DVD , this one is austere at best : a `` passable '' dolby 5.1 mix and subtitles . That 's it . Picture quality is only mildly `` acceptable '' ( dark scenes are highly pixelated and hard to understand ! ) . No director 's commentary , no behind the scenes , no nothing . For a movie that 's being praised as a LANDMARK in science fiction and billed as influential as STAR WARS , the DVD that 's available is a crying shame . Why has nobody ever bothered to release a special edition is beyond my reckoning . We see so much `` trash '' being released as a `` special edition '' and yet we still have to wait for a defenitive DVD of MAD MAX 2 . My review , as you might have guessed , is about this most criminal offense . I 's rate MAD MAX 2 with an 11 ( yep , it 's a VERY entertaining movie ) but the DVD truly stinks.Let 's hope Mr. Miller comes to his senses and releases a worthy DVD package for the film he will most likely be remembered BY !
