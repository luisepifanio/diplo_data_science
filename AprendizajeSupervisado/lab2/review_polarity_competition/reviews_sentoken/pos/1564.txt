Every year as a child I looked forward to watching Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer during the holidays . In fact , I looked forward to seeing it on TV even as an adult ! Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son , I bought it for him a few weeks ago . Sure , I had it recorded on a VHS along with other Christmas classics , but the quality was n't that great and we had to endure commercials.The DVD version seems to be cleaned up from the TV version in terms of quality . I seem to recall more background `` fuzzies '' when it was on TV ( perhaps the DVD was re-mastered ? ) The Desinty 's Child claymation video is basically worthless , in my opinion , unless you have a little fan of this kind of music ( and I do n't ) .With a run-time of 65 minutes , this DVD has hardly any extras . There 's a lost scene which originally aired in place of the song `` Why Am I Such A Misfit ? '' ( an optimistic tune about striking out and finding your fortune ) . You can also view the DVD in Spanish , and my son gets a kick out of doing that once in awhile.The `` previews '' for other DVD 's -- including an annoying promo for one about Peter Rabbit/Easter -- seems ENDLESS . It 's a shame how they advertise to death on DVD 's for youngsters ! And as far as the Rudolph story : well , I was always bothered that Rudolph 's Dad rejected him for being different -- as well as Santa himself ! Very disappointing , but is n't that like life -- where people judge based on appearances ? Still , I love the songs on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , and Hermie the dentist wanna-be , Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble bring warm holiday nostalgia to our house . And my 7 year old son plays this DVD at least once a day ! What more can you ask for ? ( except maybe some fun extras ) .
