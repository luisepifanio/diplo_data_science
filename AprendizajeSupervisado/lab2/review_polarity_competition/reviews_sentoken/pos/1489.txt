This is not the Christopher Reeve version Superman that we know and love , but it comes pretty damn close . What i liked most about this version of Superman is the deeper relationship between Lois Lane and Superman and how real it is . To me , the STORY should be just as important as the `` cool '' graphics , and Singer nails it here . Lois Lane is Superman 's love of his life , as well as Lois ' ... the two are inseparable . Despite having been gone and Lois moving on to another man , the love definitely is still there . Then of course , there is the ongoing battle between Lex Luthor and Superman , so it 's like having two great stories in one movie ! There is emotional chemistry in this film that is undeniable . You can actually feel what superman is going through throughout the film , both the good and the bad . I must have seen this movie 5 times since its release ... I give Director/screenwriter Bryan Singer a hefty two thumbs up for an engaging , emotional , well-written story .
