King Of The Zombies is a very fun movie for the entire family to enjoy ... This film stars comedian Mantan Moreland who is one of the funniest men ever in movies ... Although the film is very low budget it is well worth watching or buying just to see Mantan Moreland ... Watching this film is time well spent and will make you feel better and laugh more than you ever have ... I would advise any serious movie fan to watch this almost forgotten classic and enjoy it again and again ... thanks ... Jeff Johnson
