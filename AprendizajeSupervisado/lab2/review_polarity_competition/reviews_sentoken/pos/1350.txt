I absolutely LOVE this DVD ! Along with a healthy 1200 calorie daily diet , I have practiced this DVD every single night since May 22 , 2007 and to date have lost over 30 pounds and 12 inches off my waist . I started with ease and have worked my way up to following Suzanne thoughout the session . My back has never felt stronger and it is finally rewarding to look forward to doing a relaxing yet rewarding exercise EVERY night . However , I would like to know what type of Yoga Suzanne is practicing so that I may add a few more difficult poses to my routine . I would also love to know , since I am counting calories , approximately how many calories are burned during this 45-minute routine ? I would love to know , as well , if Suzanne has a Power Yoga DVD . I enjoy her as an instructor and would prefer to follow her as I become more and more flexible.Again , I definitely recommend this DVD ! It has brought me confidence and literally makes me stand a little bit taller .
