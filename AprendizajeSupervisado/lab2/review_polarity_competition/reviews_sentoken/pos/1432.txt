It 's a very enjoyable Fred Astaire movie and has the dancing on the ceiling episode that is regarded as a movie milestone . And the face and form of Jane Powell is very easy on the eyes . There is disappointment with the video quality ( grainy ) , but the movie is delightful nonetheless . There are three DVD editions of this movie that I 'm aware of , I 've had all three . I 've kept the Madacy set and given the other two as gifts .
