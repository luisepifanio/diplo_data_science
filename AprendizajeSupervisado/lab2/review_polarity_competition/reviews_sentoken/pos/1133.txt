In 1879 a British column was nearly annihiliated by a large `` impi '' of Zulu warriors near Isandhlwana . Afterward , a small British force encamped at nearby Rorke 's Drift ( a trading station and mission ) consisting of 104 fit soldiers and a number of invalids in a makeshift hospital became the next target . For two days the station was attacked by waves of Zulu warriors . The total number of attackers was about 4500 . In the end , nearly 400 Zulus were killed in comparison with only about 20 of the defenders , the hospital was burned to the ground , and 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the survivors.The movie itself is a reasonably faithful re-creation of the events at Rorke 's Drift , with good acting by Michael Caine , Stanley Baker , and a large supporting cast of Zulus . The ferocity of the assault , the stubborn , desperate defence by the small garrison , and the chaos of hand-to-hand combat at the barricades can all be felt through the cinematography . One wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were shot using huge numbers of actors in the role of Zulu warriors , who were obviously able to re-create the tactics and movement of the real army of 1879 . Their war cries , synchronised clashing spear-on-shield movements , and in-formation advancement create the sense of a real army moving to attack the apparently doomed garrison . This is one of very few films that gives the viewer a sense of what combat must have been like in the days before mechanised armies appeared on the scene .
