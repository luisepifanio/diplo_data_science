This is perhaps the best Vacation film -- any time of the year ! Although others were complaining about the special features , and no deleted scenes that they saw on tv , I got what I paid for . I would do it again , and if you have n't seen it , rent it . I do n't care what time of the year it is ; any time 's a good time for Christmas Vacation . Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback .
