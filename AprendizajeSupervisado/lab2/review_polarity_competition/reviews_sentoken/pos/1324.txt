Predator is my favorite Schwarzenegger flick , closely followed by Commando . It has the usual stuff I like in an action film - muscles , big weapons , bad dialogue , and it has Arnold , which raises it above the level of other action films.I wo n't waste anyone 's time by describing the plot of this film ( I 'm wagering $ 5 that you know it already ) , but I would just like to remind you that if you have n't seen this film recently , it 's about that time to `` stick around , '' stop being such a `` pencil-pusher '' and watch the film again.Excellent film , always fun to watch
