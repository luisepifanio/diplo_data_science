There are not many movies worth purchasing again just because they 're now available in Blu-Ray , but this is one of them . The message of Kubrick 's Vietnam War drama is more poignant when seen in all its original splendor . Do n't miss you chance to experience the haunting soundtrack and imerse yourself in a forgotten time of US history . Who knew is was all shot in England !
