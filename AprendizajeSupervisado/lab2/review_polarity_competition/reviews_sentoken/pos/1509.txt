This is a great John Travolta comedy that was probably inspired by a true story in Pittsburgh Pennsyvania back in 1980 , when a local popular television celebrity `` Nick Perry '' was allegedly involved in a televised lottery fix and had to serve prison time.Anyway , it 's an interesting must see movie ! ! ! ! !
