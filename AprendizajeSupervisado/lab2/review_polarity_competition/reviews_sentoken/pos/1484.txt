Right up there with `` Planes , Trains & Automobiles '' and `` There 's Something About Mary '' there 's my favorite Billy Murray comedy ... . `` Goundhog Day '' . Murray ( as TV Weatherman Phil Connors ) is easily the movie 's lone Hollywood star , as the rest of the cast are much lesser known in the field . Andie MacDowell was probably better known for her career in modeling in 1993 , than as an actress ... she does a simply wonderful job as `` Rita '' the TV Producer . Chris Elliot does a fine job in a less annoying role than he 's used to as `` Larry '' the cameraman ( he 's come a long way since being `` The Man Under The Stairs '' on David Letterman ) . The other actor to really make an impression is the man with the recognizable face , but what 's his name ( Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned `` Bing ! '' Ryerson ) . Oh , and Scooter the groundhog . As for the story , Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day ( which happens to be Groundhog Day ) in Punxsutawney , PA covering the now famous festivities . He keeps reliving the same day , over and over again . Everyday he sees the same things . Everyday he meets the same people ... the man in the hallway early in the morning , Doris the waitress , the town mayor , etc . He decides to make the best of the situation and do whatever he wants ... only because he knows he 'll wake up the next day and it will be the same day all over again . As he grows tired of reliving the same day over and over , Connors shifts his focus to Rita . First , trying to impress her . Then , trying to really care for her . When he finally does break thru to her , the spell is broken and the next day appears . I rank some of Bill Murray 's movies as classic ... i.e . `` Caddyshack '' , `` Stripes '' , `` Scrooged '' , `` What About Bob '' , etc ... but I put `` Groundhog Day '' at the top of the list . Easy choice for my # 1 favorite Bill Murray movie . Also an easy pick for one of my top 4-5 comedies all-time . *****
