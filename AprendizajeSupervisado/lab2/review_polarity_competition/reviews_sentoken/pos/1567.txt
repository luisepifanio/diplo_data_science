Got this film because I 'm a huge Vincent D'Onofrio fan . The movie stays amazingly true to the book `` Heart of the Old Country . '' All of the actors turn in solid performances and the story has a good twist . Kevin Zegers carries off his part as a young man searching for something more in life . The father-son relationship is well played . D'Onofrio once again brings a third dimension to his role . Good movie . Great Vincent .
