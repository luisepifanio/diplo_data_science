Gregory Peck plays magnificently the role of squadron commander of a precision bombing squadron during WWII . Playing & quot ; General Savage & quot ; , Peck 's role is that of an incoming commander with strict military discipline beliefs to get the most of his men and bring out in them what they lacked with their prior commander . The script itself is entertaining with non-stop philosphies and suspense . I would recommend this movie very strongly as a training video for those people in professions where leadership is the key to success . Watch closely as General Savage incorporates strict discipline with temperance in his interactions with his men . With the gain of respect , he has also earned the troops ' trust . This form of leadership is almost non-existent today . However , it is literally , & quot ; combat proven & quot ; .
