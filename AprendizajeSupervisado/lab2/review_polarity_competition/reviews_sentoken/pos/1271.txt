To begin , I 'm a life-long bodybuilder and Arnold Schwarzenegger fan , so , although he 's strictly a co-star in this , I 'm obviously biased . That being said , however , I absolutely LOVE this movie all around ! One of my favorite parts is the way some of the very best advice I 've ever heard on friendships and relationships in general is dispensed throughout the film at times you did n't even realize you were learning something . Examples : Joe Santo ( Arnold ) is putting Craig Blake ( Jeff Bridges ) through a workout and advising him , `` You ca n't grow without burning ! `` , and we come to realize just how profound that was when Joe repeats those words as the two dispute just why Mary Tate Farnsworth ( Sally Field ) left Joe for Craig . Also , there 's Craig 's uncle Albert , whose voice is heard previously at times reading letters to Craig , telling him , `` It does n't matter what you do , as long as you do something , and do it unsparingly. '' . Again , awesome movie . I 've worn out two videos of it thusfar , having watched it so many times . Time to get ANOTHER one ...
