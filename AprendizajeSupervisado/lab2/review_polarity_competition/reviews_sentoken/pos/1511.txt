This movie is rediculously funny . It 's just an 80 's action movie plain and simple . You can barely get into the fact that you 're watching a movie before the action starts , and then that 's the rest of the movie . Tons of action movies cliches , and yes the Arnold one-liners . The wonderful one-liners . I also agree with what I 've seen around the internet that Vernon Wells character `` Bennet '' , sucks . Some people think he is wearing chain mail for some reason , so do n't let that fool you into thinking he is dressed as a medieval knight . None the less , 5 stars , pick it up .
