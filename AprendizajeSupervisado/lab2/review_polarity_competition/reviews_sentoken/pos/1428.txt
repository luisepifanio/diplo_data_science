We are a 3 generation Mary Poppins family . I saw it as a young child -- when it first came out , grew up with the MP music books and repeated viewings of Mary Poppins.I ordered the VCR tape approximately 20 years ago at a premium price . I am still using it . My 3 sons grew up with Mary Poppins , learning each and every line to the songs and script . They played `` Mary Poppins '' . Now my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter is the biggest fan -- 2-3 times a day the video is viewed . I purchased 2 sets of the DVDs as well as the music CDs for 2004 Christmas . Our granddaughter sings to the music , knows each scene and hushes us as not to miss a particular song . She does the Spit-Spot mirror scene-hand gestures and all ! Mary Poppins -- is wonderful !
