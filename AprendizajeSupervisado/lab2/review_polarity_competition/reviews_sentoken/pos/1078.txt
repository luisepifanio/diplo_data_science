Some people drift through life , moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye ; others latch on to a cause , another person or a principle and remain adamant , committed to whatever it is -- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it . But we & # 65533 ; re all different , & # 65533 ; Made of different clay , & # 65533 ; as one of the characters in this film puts it , which is what makes life so interesting . Some people are just plain crazy , though -- and maybe that & # 65533 ; s the way you have to be to live among the masses . Who knows ? Who knows what it takes to make things -- life -- work ? Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it , using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed -- and how one & # 65533 ; gets & # 65533 ; committed -- and obsession , in & # 65533 ; Committed , & # 65533 ; starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant , committed , obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy , too . Her name is Joline , and this is her story . Admittedly , Joline has always been a committed person ; in work , relationships , in life in general . She & # 65533 ; s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what . And when she marries Carl ( Luke Wilson ) , it & # 65533 ; s forever . The only problem is , someone forgot to tell Carl -- and 597 days into the marriage , he & # 65533 ; s gone ; off to & # 65533 ; find & # 65533 ; himself and figure it all out . When Joline realizes he & # 65533 ; s not coming back , she refuses to give up on him , or their marriage . Maybe it & # 65533 ; s because of that & # 65533 ; clay & # 65533 ; she & # 65533 ; s made of . Regardless , she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him , which she does -- in El Paso , Texas , of all places . But once she knows where he is , she keeps her distance , giving him his & # 65533 ; space & # 65533 ; and not even letting him know she & # 65533 ; s there . She considers Carl as being in a & # 65533 ; spiritual coma , & # 65533 ; and it & # 65533 ; s her job to keep a & # 65533 ; spiritual vigil & # 65533 ; over him until he comes to his senses . And while she watches and waits , her life is anything but dull , as she encounters a young woman named Carmen ( Patricia Velazquez ) , a waitress at one of the local eateries ; Carmen & # 65533 ; s & # 65533 ; Grampy , & # 65533 ; ( Alfonso Arau ) , who is something of a mystic ; T-Bo ( Mark Ruffalo ) , a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl ; and Neil ( Goran Visnjic ) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her . For Joline , it & # 65533 ; s a journey of discovery , during which she learns a lot about Carl , but even more about herself . There & # 65533 ; s a touch of humor , a touch of romance , and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot . And Krueger presents it all extremely well , delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining . Her characters are very real people , with all the wants , needs and imperfections that make up the human condition ; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story . We see it from Joline & # 65533 ; s point-of-view , as Krueger makes us privy to Joline & # 65533 ; s thoughts and therefore her motivations , which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold . That , along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates , makes for a very effective piece of storytelling . There & # 65533 ; s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter , but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters . And the result is a well textured , affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life . Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation . She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable , adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person , and one that is real . And for this film to work , it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable -- and Graham succeeds on all fronts . Her screen presence has never been more alluring , and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes , is enough to draw you in entirely . it & # 65533 ; s all a part of the character she creates ; there & # 65533 ; s an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance , who she is inside and out . She & # 65533 ; s a likable , agreeable person , and because you & # 65533 ; ve shared her innermost thoughts , you know who she is . It & # 65533 ; s a good job all the way around , beginning with the way the character was written , to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life . As Carmen , Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging , as well . Her performance is very natural and straightforward , and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character . She has a charismatic presence , but is less than flamboyant , and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth . She is refreshingly open and up-front ; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back , but is totally honest on all fronts , and that , too , is part of her appeal . And , as with Joline , this character is well written , and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life . Overall , there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film , including those of Luke Wilson , Casey Affleck ( as Joline & # 65533 ; s brother , Jay ) , Goran Visnjic , Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo , who , with very little actual screen time , manages to create a memorable character . The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens ( Jenny ) , Clea Du Vall ( Mimi ) , Summer Phoenix ( Meg ) , Art Alexakis ( New York Car Thief ) , Dylan Baker ( Carl & # 65533 ; s Editor ) , and Mary Kay Place ( Psychiatrist ) . A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture -- reflecting upon who we are , where we & # 65533 ; re going and what we really need -- & # 65533 ; Committed & # 65533 ; is an enjoyable experience ; a ride definitely worth taking .
