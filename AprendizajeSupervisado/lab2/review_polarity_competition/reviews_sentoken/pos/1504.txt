There are those that criticize JFK , claiming that Oliver Stone disreguarded facts and rewrote history . True or not , this completely misses the point . Stone himself said that his intention in making the film was to get his audience to question authority and think for themselves . The film is presented as one POSSIBLE explanation ( a combination of two separate theories ) for the unusual events leading to Kennedy 's assasination , and it actually raises more questions than it answers . The cast is phenomenal . The award-winning cinematography and editing are groundbreaking to say the least . Despite your opinion of JFK 's politics , the film is one of the very , very few that I would dare say is perfect . It is the reason I am a filmmaker , and is worth every second you spend watching it . You will never forget it .
