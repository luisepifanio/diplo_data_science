I believe that decades from now when film school students study the history of American animation , the Iron Giant will be seen as perhaps the last great example of traditionally hand-drawn animated movies , before the switch to computer animation a la Finding Nemo.The saddest thing about this movie is that when it was originally released in theaters , its promotion was so under-funded and just plain bad , that it was n't very successful . Thankfully , it has gotten a devoted following on VHS and DVD.This movie is an example of what animated movies routinely accomplish in Japan , but rarely do here in the U.S . It 's well written , visually impressive , and works for all ages , not just children.Be warned that it may not be suitable for very young children . The climactic battle sequence features a potentially scary transformation of the Iron Giant . Do n't get me wrong , this movie is suitable for all but the youngest viewers and *most* very young kids can probably deal with it just fine . But some kids are more sensitive and nightmare-prone than others , so if you have kids under the age of 6 , I suggest you preview the movie before allowing them to watch it.Some movies are best rented , others are best purchased . This is in the latter category : it 's a keeper ! If you 're an adult that has written off animated movies as `` kid 's stuff '' because they tend to be trite and formulaic , you owe it to yourself to see this movie.So many reviewers are so easily pleased that they appear incapable of giving less than 5 stars , which is a shame , because this is a movie that deserves to stand out from the crowd , and absolutely earned its 5 star rating .
