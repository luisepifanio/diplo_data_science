This is my favorite Christmas movie - it is not typical Christmas hype , just a great movie all in the family can enjoy together . It takes place during WWII , the Battle of the Bulge , when a mother ( Linda Hamilton ) flees with her son to safety and hides out in a small cabin in the wilderness to avoid being captured by the Nazi 's . Soon there are both Americans and Germans invading her space to get out of the freezing cold and what transpires is captivating and moving . This all takes place during Christmas week . Highly recommended . I just ordered a several copies for gifts . Even the price is right .
