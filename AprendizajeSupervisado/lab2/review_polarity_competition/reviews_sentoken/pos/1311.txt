Everything 's been covered by other reviewers , but I wanted to ask if CBS would please add the option to run EVERY episode with the bumpers intact . Right now , only a few include the option to have the `` Bonanza will return after these messages '' , and `` And now.. the exciting conclusion of Bonanza '' . It would be awesome to be able to have those included with every episode . That 's all I have to say , except please bring the season sets out more often .
