Clint Walker as the impossibly handsome , honest cowpoke , who tries to avoid trouble , but will fight for common decency , honesty , and values is the epitome of the western hero . Great episodes of an EVERYMAN that we need for this day and age . Themes of Good versus EVIL , weave through every episode . It 's a simple formula , but brings back memories of simpler times in 1950 's America . This three show DVD brings back the adult westerns . Not just shoot-em-ups , but with drama as a major component . ( There is plenty of action to be sure . ) THE BEST of the GENRE ! Looking for all the seasons to be released !
