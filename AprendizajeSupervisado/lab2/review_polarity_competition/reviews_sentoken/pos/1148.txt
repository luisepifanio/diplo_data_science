I have a stubborn little girl who has been resisting the potty since she was 2 also . I felt like she `` knew '' how to do it , but she was purposely being difficult -- some kind of power struggle or something . She loves the DVD ! She watched it over and over every day for about 2 weeks but would n't do it herself . A combination of perseverance and PANTIES -- not PULLUPS , along with the DVD really helped . She is still saying ... '' I can do it just like Potty Power ! ! ! '' She is so excited and so are we . No more diapers OR Pull Ups OR accidents just 3 weeks after she decided to get serious about this.. Good luck..I highly recommend it . I must add that I think the `` power '' behind this little movie is that it uses some postive peer influences . You see all these cute and happy little kids using the potty and being proud of themselves , throwing out diapers , etc . Great idea..because the next best thing is having your toddler around another toddler who has started to potty train .
