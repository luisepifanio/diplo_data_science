CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES is a nocturne of a film , a story that gently meanders through the lives of four people and with very few words says quite a bit about human relationships , about the cocoons we spin about ourselves for safety , for protection against fear , for hoping the chrysalis will metamorphose into a butterfly or moth . Eric Byler is to be commended for having the courage to keep this story simple - a tale of four personality 'disorders ' and how they find the means to exist in this odd world . Michael Idemoto is perhaps the loneliest outwardly , but all four characters seem to crave connection and simply can not attach . Eugenia Yuan is the idiosyncratic girl-child , Jacquelyn Kim is the woman of mystery who with Matt Westmore plays more of a catalytic agent than a character . All four actors are beautiful , sensitive , and convincing . The lighting and settings are well chosen . In all , this little indie film is a quiet diversion , dealing more with what is not said than with just a script .
