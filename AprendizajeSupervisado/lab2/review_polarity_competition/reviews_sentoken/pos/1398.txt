This review is for the Criterion COllection DVD edition of the film . The film 's original French title is & quot ; Du Rifiif Chez les Hommes & quot ; which translates to & quot ; Trouble with the Men & quot ; The film is really good and is about several men who plot to break into a jewelery store , crack open the safe , and escape- all without setting off the alarm . Several of the scenes have been imitated in other films : notably Mission Impossible and the remake of the Italain Job . Many scenes are quite exciting and the break-in scene is very exciting . This half-hour scene also contains no dialogue making it one of the longest if not the longest elapsed time without dialogue in a film with dialogue . This is definately one of the best break-in films which I have seen and is certainly worthy of a Criterion Collection release . There are also several special features . There is a theatrical trailer , Production stills and notes , a video interview with the Director , Jules Dassin , who also personally apporved this edition , and drawings of the sets by Alexandre Trauner . There is also an optional English language soundtrack for those bothered by foreign language with subitles . Either way , this is a film that no fan of heist films should miss !
