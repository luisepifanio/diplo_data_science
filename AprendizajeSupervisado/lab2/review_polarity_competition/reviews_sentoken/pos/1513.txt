I am not as articulate as some of the others reviewing here . All i can simply say about this is that we need this type of entertainment so desperately . This series fuses together the many various beliefs in the supernatural , the paranormal , religion , and the side of humanity that often hides in the dark away from us because we lack the heart to accept who or what they are . This is a carnival full of freeks and geeks . Who will fight to the death for one another . This is a magical show set in a desolate place . Which is perfect . The feeling of isolation only adds to the mystery and magic of this program . The freaks are real . And we get to live amoung them for an hour at a time . And , after a while , you 'll begin to forget how different they are . Except to realize that maybe this world was made for them . And , not for us . Maybe we are the freeks . NUF said . This show is brilliant .
