The first several weeks of doing this workout , I was EXHAUSTED afterward , each time ! It really took a lot out of me . But NMTZ , along with other Jillian Michaels dvds , allowed my body to become accustomed to it . It 's still a challenge , and it 's still effective after several months . It 's never easy , but it became more doable with time.There is n't as much up and down , up and down , up and down ( standing vs on your back ) as in 30 Day Shred . There 's mat work , but it 's generally clumped together in the same circuits . NMTZ combines upper and lower body at the same time for maximum effectiveness ( calorie and fat burn ) . Excellent for the upper arms , quads , thighs and glutes.I usually do NMTZ when I do n't feel like doing high impact cardio . There are only a couple of the exercises here that I avoid , for different reasons . Surrenders really bother my knees , and pushups strain my upper body too much , leading to pain . Otherwise ... challenge yourself and stick with it , you will see results .
