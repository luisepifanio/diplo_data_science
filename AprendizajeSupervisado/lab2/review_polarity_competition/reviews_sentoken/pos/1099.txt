Once I saw that the DVD was done by Paramount Pictures I had great expectations of the quality of this picture put to Blu-ray . I was NOT disappointed ! I found it to be as good as any Blu-ray I own . I only wish the audio had been done with AC-3 ( 5.1 ) instead of stereo then it would have been perfect . The stunning video was so good I soon found myself forgetting about the absence of the 5.1 I would have liked to have had . For those who both own a Blu-ray player and who are a fan of British Military History you WILL love this DVD .
