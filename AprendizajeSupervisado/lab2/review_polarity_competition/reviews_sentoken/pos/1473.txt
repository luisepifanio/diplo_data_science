For far too often , Hollywood has announced a film 'Based on a True Story ' only to go on to so twist and add to the true-life story that the film becomes a lie.Not here.This is absolutely true - the story of one of the most incredible mountaineering accidents that has ever taken place.Filmed as both a re-enactment and as a documentary - with the three main characters recounting the tale in their own words - was a stroke of genius.How can I review it before it 's released ? Here in the UK , this DVD has been out for a few months - everyone we 've played it to has sat wide-eyed in amazement at a most unusually constructed but totally true-to-life film .
