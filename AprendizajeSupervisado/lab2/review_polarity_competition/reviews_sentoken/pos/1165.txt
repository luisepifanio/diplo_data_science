The Italian Job is the finest film ever made , without a shadow of a doubt . Usually , I agree with Leonard Maltin , but sometimes he 's way off the scale and he most certainly is in this case.Okay , you might feel that the characterisation is poor - but they 're meant to be stereotypes . This film was ironic way before Kevin Williamson and his kind were even born.It 's worth knowing that the UK censors in 1968 would not allow any film to be released which made it appear that crime pays so the ending was tied to that one condition.If you only buy one video from amazon ever ( and that would not be good - they have a huge range of fine quality films - might i personally recommend The Quiet Man , for instance ? ) make it this one .
