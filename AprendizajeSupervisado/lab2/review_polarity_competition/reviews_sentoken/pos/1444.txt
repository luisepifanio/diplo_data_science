I 've been using this video for a few days and boy does it wear me out ! I 'm not sure how I feel about Billy Blanks and his wife . I can see how people would find them annoying . But the workout itself is a blast ( I was surprised that I really enjoyed the African dance the most ) and easy to follow . I have no dance experinece and I had very little trouble following Billy Blanks . I chose this DVD because I hate to work out and I 'm really enjoying it . I ca n't wait to get the other one .
