This movie starts fast and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialog and action that blazes along making it difficult to keep up . The important thing is to hang in there and the pieces will all start to fit together . The movie is based on a novella by Philip K. Dick who is known for his highly original imagination and who has come up with ideas for stories unlike anyone else . This is another one of those original story lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride.Fortunately the pieces begin to all fit together and do so with dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of action on screen . The basic premise of the movie is a technology has developed that permits the viewing of a crime before it actually happens so police can step in and stop the crime before it has taken place . Just as this system of crime prevention is ready to go nationwide something happens that changes everything . The Tom Cruise character , a policeman named John Anderton , is suddenly plunged into a situation that threatens his very life.He must now use the crime prevention system called Precrime to find out the truth and discover who is out to frame him . His search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie.I encourage the viewer to give the movie a chance because although at first it might seem confusing it quickly shapes up into a good sci-fi adventure movie .
