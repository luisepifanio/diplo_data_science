This 1955 release is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of his bigger films like & quot ; Rashomon & quot ; and & quot ; Seven Samurai & quot ; but it 's still worth seeing . The great Toshiro Mifune plays an industrialist in post-World War II Japan who is slowly going mad with the notion that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family ( and his mistresses ) to flee Japan with him . Mifune 's obsessive portrayal is the stuff of great tragedy especially as he vainly pleads with his greedy family to leave and Takashi Shimura , the samurai leader in & quot ; Seven Samurai & quot ; , is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten the mess out . The movie captures Japanese dread about the atom bomb , a subject Kurosawa would also treat in his masterpiece , & quot ; Ikiru & quot ; , very well and with the greedy family closing in on a raving patriarch , brings to mind & quot ; King Lear & quot ; , a tale the director would go back to many years later in & quot ; Ran & quot ; . This is a small film from one of the world 's great directors but a very good one .
