Not only was the animation the best I 've seen yet from Pixar , but the story of Remy the French rat trying to be a 1st class chef was great . Amazing performances , great action which surprised me . I absolutely love this movie ! Easily the best Pixar movie to date w/ The Incredibles a close 2nd . Ca n't wait to pick up the Full HD 1080P Video & Linear PCM Audio Blu-ray disc of Ratatouille !
