WOW . This film was so inspiring for a few reasons . One , it was a quality , uplifting , movie about an African American father -- so rare to see in film . Second , it offered reassurance to me and hope , that just because I am grieving long , that does not make me unusual . So much of what this father illustrated in grief , I 'm struggling with . It was so refreshing not to have heard God 's name trashed in this film , as seems to be the norm by actors these days . Very powerful . Thank you Amazon .
