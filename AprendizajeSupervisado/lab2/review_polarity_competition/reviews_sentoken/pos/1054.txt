If ever a film needed English subtitles this is one . The accents and soft talking are great but hard to follow storyline as you ca n't understand what they are saying and with no subtitles . Her songs were just beautiful and the story is great but a lot of it is lost on not catching what they are saying . But is was a refreshing movie from most out there now . Fine acting and story .
