Bob Dylan is without a doubt the best folk or rock musician ever . The MTV Unplugged is a showcase of some of his best work . Some of my Favorite selections are John Brown , Dignity , All Along The Watchtower , and Like A Rolling Stone . I truly believe that Bob Dylan influenced modern music more than any other person or group . This performance is essential for any music lover .
