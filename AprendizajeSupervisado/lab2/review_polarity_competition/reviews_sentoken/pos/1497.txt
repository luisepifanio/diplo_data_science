I can not rave more about this DVD ! ! ! ! I think they did the best they could with incorporating music with phonics . I swear , my 6 year old who is in first grade had a dramatic improvement in reading and spelling after watching this video . At the beginning of the school year , she was averaging 3 out of 8 on her spelling and on her first report card , the teacher said she needed more assistance with reading . I turned on this video a couple of times during the week for a few weeks for her to watch and each time I started it at a different chapter . There has been a dramatic improvement in her reading and spelling . Now she has gotten an 8/8 on her spelling . She started coming home with stickers each day from school that she said she got for doing a good job in reading . She said that this phonics video taught her how to read ! ! ! Just a few weeks ago , we were barely getting through Dora phonics series and now she is reading books to me that she got from the library which are at a second grade level . Awesome video ! ! ! ! I think all Kindergarten and First grade teachers should use this video to supplement there teaching . Students relate to this much better than a teacher standing up trying to teach it .
