This boundary breaking film is the best film I have ever seen . Easy to dismiss as a `` gay '' film , it is so much more . It is a fully drawn character portrait of 2 characters who meet , but are not in the same spot at the time . this film chronicles their struggle from where they are to reach that point together . Director Ang Lee has ever been better . Heath Ledger unbelievably missed the Oscar but his portrayal will stay with you for a long time . This is a multi Award winning is a most memorable film !
