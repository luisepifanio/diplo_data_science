John Carpenter takes a welcome change of pace with this invisible man movie that bring great new ideas to the genre . ( best of all being that chevys clothes become invisible too so he does n't have to walk around naked ) Chevy Chase is suprisingly beleivable in the title role and Sam Neil is great as a rouge CIA agent . As you probably quessed , the special effects are also brilliant .
