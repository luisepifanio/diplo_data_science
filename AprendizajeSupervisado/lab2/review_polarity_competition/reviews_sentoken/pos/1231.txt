In the late 70 's I got caught up in the Moonie cult for a time in Northern California . This is a very accurate portrayal of the moonies of that time and place , right down to the rickety converted chicken coop they had their talks in , the cult member who follows you everwhere , the `` choo choo yay pow '' cheer . ( Yes they really did use that ! ) The enforced conformity , The famous dodge ball game with chanting . Deadly accurate . Though the material is dated , and the ranch in the countryside where The moonies brought recruits is long since shut down , it 's still a great film to watch ... and to show your kids if you want to help them learn to avoid being sucked into cults of many kinds .
