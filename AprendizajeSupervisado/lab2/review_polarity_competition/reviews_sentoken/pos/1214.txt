BUY THIS DVD SET ! Convince relatives , friends , significant others , etc . to buy it for you . Pillage , plunder ... do whatever you need to do to get your paws on this phenomenal collection of zany antics from some middle-class guys who like to dress in women 's clothing.I started out as a raving `` Holy Grail '' fan , so I had to learn more about these quirky British comedians . My boyfriend got this set for me as a gift , and it is , hands down , the oddest thing I 've ever watched . Cows mooing in German ? A woman who seduces and covertly traps milkmen in her house ? 100 yards for people with no sense of direction , marathon for incontinents ? ? ? It is SO unusual ... unlike anything else . Monty Python 's Flying Circus is CERTAINLY its own television genre . A & E definitely made sure that each episode was transferred to DVD in high quality , and there are nifty post-viewing quizzes included on each DVD ( just to make sure you were paying attention ! ) The DVD cases and box set are attractively packaged , making this a must-buy ! Even if you 've only seen one Monty Python movie . Even if you 've only heard of Monty Python . Even if you have n't . Make a wise investment and purchase this set ! You will own hours of hilarity and amusement as only these boys can give it to you !
