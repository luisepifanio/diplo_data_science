I too really love the original theatrical release and bought the 2-disc edition awhile back . I do generally have an aversion to Hollywood marketing ploys , but from what I heard Mark Steven Johnson on his commentary from the previous release , they were really crunched on time during the production , especially with some of the CG stuff . They also battled quite a bit with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 rating . ( It 's difficult to be true to the darkness in the comic book series while marketing it for the most optimum revenue returns . ) Hopefully , they 've taken the time to sensically incorporate the extra fight footage into the story and brush up on a few of the painful CG shots ( amidst many good ones ) . Marketing ploys aside , I think there 's added pressure for directors these days to `` get the product out the door '' that they have to make various artistic compromises ( & agrave ; la LOTR ) . I really do hope that this DVD was made for Johnson to `` complete his original vision '' for an already good film !
