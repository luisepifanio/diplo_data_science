I grew up with The Italian Job in the UK . It was one of those films the BBC used to show all the time . My friends and I have been watching the video for years - we put it on whenever a boozed-up night of shouting out the classic lines is required , e.g . & quot ; He was put away for doing something disgusting with a net. & quot ; Just typing it in makes me laugh , see the film and you 'll see what I mean . Add to that a bizarre Mini car chase , a singalong Cockney soundtrack and an authentic swinging London 60s setting and it 's a must-see .
