I do n't like this movie . It deserves 5 stars for superb acting , an horrific and heartwrenching story based on the true accounts , grim sets and photography , and a pervading mood of despair.A German journalist , Nina Hoss as the dark eyed , beat-up , unintentional siren , stays behind in Berlin to document the invasion by the Russians ( Soviets ) . Soon , she finds herself caught up in the rape and destruction of the city , and it 's helpless civilians . After repeated attacks against herself , in desperation , she seeks out a protector , and finds a mysterious Russian officer ( Evgeny Sidikhin ) with a haunted past . Interested in her but somewhat reluctantly , he agrees , and what follows becomes a tale of relationships and common ground amidst hell on earth.Without wanting to justify them , the writers , to a degree , show both sides of the conflict . The Russians , in general , long for their families , hate the war which dragged them in there , and relate awful memories of the atrocities that the Germans laid on their homeland . Paying evil for evil does not make right their actions in any way , but I suppose it brings a sort of balance and understanding to the story.Thankfully , the assaults are shown non-gratuitously , and there is a scene of nudity to make a point , but that 's about it for graphic filming . But one gets the message . The whole film is depressing . I think the only sense of hope provided comes from the heroine 's desire to survive , to keep her sanity and a sense of decency no matter what.The written epilogue is almost as disturbing . Societies ' answer is to hide away it 's past instead of dealing with it . A tough film . I wo n't watch it again .
