I remember watching `` What 's Happening '' in the 70s/80s . However , I ca n't recall ever seeing it in the 90s or 00s in syndication . That 's why watching this DVD was such a blast ... it was like re-living moments from my childhood ! The best compliment I can give this show is that young people LOVE it . I am friends with a family that has 7 kids , and I showed them a few episodes of this show . Now , every time I speak to the kids , they say `` Bring over 'What 's Happening ' ! '' and they laugh like crazy while watching it . In their words , the show is `` hysterical '' .
