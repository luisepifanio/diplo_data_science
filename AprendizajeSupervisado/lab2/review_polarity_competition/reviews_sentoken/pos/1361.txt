A Faustian spin through post-war New York and Louisiana , 'Angel Heart ' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully chilling angle . The plot , focusing on an increasingly violent missing person 's case , is reasonably simple , but the backstory which triggers it is remarkably complex . When you reassemble the pieces at the end it does make sense , but only just . De Niro is superb as Louis Cyphre , the 'businessman ' with some collateral to collect , infusing the role with just the right balance of sardonic humour and demonic threat . Mickey Rourke gives what will probably always be his best performance as Harry Angel , a shell-shocked war veteran and disheveled P.I . The supporting cast is excellent , especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist , and Lisa Bonet as a teen voodoo witch . But the real star here is writer/director Alan Parker . He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but powerfully unsettling image : a slow zoom on the exterior wall of a New York hotel ; a New Year 's Eve crowd in Times Square ; a descending elevator ; a sweeping stair ; the rotating blades of a fan . These images are simple , cold , yet positively brimming with hellish menace . Trevor Jones 's music is the perfect accompaniment , its saxophones careening wildly over menacing rhythms and the ubiquitous throb of a beating heart . It 's a thoroughly disturbing marriage which will have fear closing around you with the same grim certainty as the protagonist 's fate .
