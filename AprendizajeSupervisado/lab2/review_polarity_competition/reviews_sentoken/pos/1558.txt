`` Elvis : That 's The Way It Is '' captures King Presley at an interesting cross-roads in his career . With his true talents largely wasted after too many years in Hollywood , Elvis found himself usurped as the `` King Of Rock and Roll '' by the likes of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones . This documentary , filmed in the summer of 1970 as he prepared for an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas , finds Elvis ready and in prime condition to reclaim his throne ! The documentary shows him at age 35 , fit and trim , and having a lot of fun ! To see Elvis having fun -- that in itself is a joy ! Elvis had a fine sense of muscianship and his craft . He expected a lot from the people he worked with ; and he knew exactly how to get the best out of everybody . It is obvious here that Elvis loved working with his band and back-up singers ; and they loved working with him . Elvis gave criticism in a gentle , funny way . When his band has difficulty with the middle section of `` Bridge Over Troubled Water '' , Elvis comments , `` If it goes that way , it goes that way , but we do n't have to emphasize it . `` The concert footage itself proves that Elvis may very well have been the hardest working man in show-business . It also proves that Elvis had `` it '' -- that indefinable , often indescrible X-Factor ( or in his case , factors ) that mark the difference between an entertainer and a superstar . Elvis was a superstar with a capital `` S '' -- possessing a potent combination of charisma , sex appeal , musicianship and showmanship . Elvis ' charisma , in particular , fairly burns up the stage . Elvis does all he can to please his audience . During a lengthy rendition of `` Love Me Tender , '' he goes out into the audience , kissing as many women , and shaking hands with as many men , as possible . He sings a Greatest Hits Medley largely for laughs ( changing lyrics to `` forget about the past , before I kick your a # # '' ) . Mid-way through the concert , Elvis is just getting started , delivering mighty renditions of `` In The Ghetto , '' `` You 've Lost That Loving Feeling '' and `` Polk Salad Annie . '' His extended , super-charged and super-sweaty rendition of `` Suspicious Minds '' will likely leave viewers as exhausted as Elvis at the end . As the end credits roll , we see Elvis greeting fellow celebrities after the performance . Sammy Davis , Jr. , clearly in awe , remarks , `` Man , you reveed up and you never stopped ! '' When he is congratulated on a wonderful show , Elvis modestly replies , `` Well , it was a sweaty show . '' The DVD Special Edition includes two versions , but stick with the more recent Restored Edition and skip the original 1970 theatrical version . The 1970 theatrical version has testimonials from fans that are unnecessary . The Restored Version has more footage of Elvis in action . `` Elvis : That 's The Way It Is '' is the way Elvis should always be remembered !
