It seems that no other Broadway musical was ever transferred so intact to the screen with every facet of its production gleaming and gloriously theatrical in its staging . River City , Iowa , of course , looks no more realistic than the Land of Oz , but that 's how it should be . It 's satire , and thankfully director Morton DaCosta keeps it all in tip-top shape , preserved to play exactly as it did on stage , even with respect to the opening number aboard a train where all the salesmen are singing about a certain scoundrel posing as a professor of music.Meredith Willson 's music never sounded as good and is given expert singing and dancing from ROBERT PRESTON , SHIRLEY JONES , PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD in the leads , all of whom are aided and abetted by some of the best singing and dancing you could ask for in a musical of this kind . Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford as her husband , the Mayor of River City , is equally boisterous in a comic role . But it 's Preston 's show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones in fine vocal form as the skeptical librarian.One of the most cleverly staged numbers is the `` Marian , The Librarian '' number that takes place in the town library where sliding poles and balconies become part of the intricately staged dance routine . All of the musical numbers are performed with professional charm by a talented group of actors/singers/dancers who are part of the River City citizenry.Little Ron Howard , the boy with the lisp , who later went on to directorial fame , is a standout as Jones ' little brother.Summing up : Outstanding old-fashioned musical with its heart in the right place -- Americana in the best tradition of the word.Summing up : It has more charm than the law allows .
