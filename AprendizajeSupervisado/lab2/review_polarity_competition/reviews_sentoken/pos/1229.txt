For the most part I 've actually liked most of the stuff that Paul Anderson has done ; nothing amazing but still some decent stuff . So I was n't ready to condemn this movie before I saw it in the theater . I was hoping he would do a lot more with this franchise than what this movie turned out to be but I still found it enjoyable enough to buy the DVD and now the Blu-Ray ( I certainly feel it is a better film than the second Predator and the 3rd & 4th Aliens . ) The Blu-Ray includes the unrated/director 's cut and the added scenes help explain some more of the story and is definitely the best version to watch.The acting is pretty blah ( with the A & P out-acting most of the humans ) though Ewen Bremner is funny . But the action is really what this movie is about and there is plenty of action here and what I thought was a very good ending.As for the Blu-Ray transfer , it is very good ; the picture is very clear and the dark scenes ( most of the movie ) look very good . The soundtrack is also nice and the trivia extra feature is cool .
