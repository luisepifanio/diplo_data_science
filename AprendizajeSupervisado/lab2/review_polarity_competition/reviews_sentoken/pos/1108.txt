This movie is a must have - one that you can watch at least once a year . It is entertaining with fine performances from Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith . Despite Melanie being a very average actor , her style works in this movie . The type of character required ie . ditzy blonde , meant she could just be herself really . On top of that , her baby voice works for the role . Working Girl is a beaut comedy focussing on an unlikely rise to the top , but when you think about it carefully , it shows that anyone , can get to where they want to , if they have the determination and guts . This is a good message to get across , I feel . Working Girl could have made Melanie a big star but it didnt quite open the doors she thought it would . She may have got more roles after this , but not one of them was worth watching ! I refer to flops like Bonfire Vanities , Stormy Monday ( plain urgh ! ) , Shining Through , and one with ex hubby Don Johnson - the title escapes me . I think Melanie 's inability to get rid of that baby voice killed her career really .
