When I began using this tape , I could not touch my toes , I was in terrible pain constantly and there was talk about me losing my license because my mobility was so bad . Now , two months later , using only this tape and a little portion control in my diet , I can fit into clothes I have not been able to fit into for 2-3 years . Between this DVD and a chiropractor , I can walk again without pain and get up my stairs without even breathing hard , and I no longer need to be on tons of narchotics . If you suffer from lost mobility , bad disks , chronic pain disorders etc. , ( I had all of them ! ) I highly recommend this ! The step ups in difficulty level are perfect for those who are overweight and/or have mobility issues . It 's wonderful !
