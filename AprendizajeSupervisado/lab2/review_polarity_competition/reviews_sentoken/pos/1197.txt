Once in a blue moon , a crowd pleaser comes along that soars the spirit . `` Strictly Ballroom '' is one of those movies.Directed in a delicious high-key style by Baz Luhrmann ( WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 'S ROMEO + JULIET , MOULIN ROUGE ) in his madcap debut ( the first in what would be called the Red Curtain Trilogy ) , the film tells the story of a top ballroom dancer who pairs with a plain , left-footed ugly duckling , when his maverick style earns him the disdain of his more conventionally-minded colleagues . Together , they give it their all and aim to make dreams of the National Championship title come true.To say this film is amazing would be an understatement . It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and awe-inducing films ever made . The cast is simply magnificant and Luhrmann introduces his clever , fast-paced directing and editing style here . He brilliantly uses a documentary style opening and ocassional interludes which help better understand the lovable characters . It works wonderfully ! This is definitely the feel-good movie of the decade . It 's hypnotic , strange , and deeply heartfelt -- a deliciously entertaining crowd-pleaser . A highly recommended must !
