It 's been fun reading these posts by people who were so moved and entertained by this movie . I saw it when it first came out and have had Cat Stevens ' songs in my head ever since . It 's one of those personally affecting movies that prompts fans to quote from it , and my favorite moment after all these years is ( as it is for some of these other writers ) Maude flinging Harold 's charm into the river , because now she 'll & quot ; always know where it is. & quot ; That was my first taste of movie profundity , and I 've never lost it.If you have n't seen the movie yet , you can probably read some of these posts and not have it ruined for you . There 's so much to laugh at and marvel over in it , and of course , those songs . . . .
