As a longtime Strauss enthusiast , it took me an inexplicably long time to learn to love this opera . It was this performance that finally brought me around . B & ouml ; hm leads a magnificant and authoritative traversal of the score and the casting is nearly ideal . While the role of Salome stretches Stratas ' voice to its limits , she is visually and dramatically the most appropriate Salome on video so far . The production , from 1974 , is a bit dated , but not enough to be disruptive to the viewer . This may be the perfect DVD for those who are new to this opera and for those who know it well . I 'd give it more than five stars , if possible !
