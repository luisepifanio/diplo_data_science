Certainly the best Carmen I have seen , other than the Domingo film ( I 've not seen the van Otter performance ) . The highlights are of course the performances of the soprano leads Domashenko and Dashuk ; both of them get their roles dead right , even if the former is a little unsubtle - but somehow I do n't think Carmen was a lady of nuances . One simply has to remark on their beauty - they are really stunning to look at . I watched a Turandot a few nights ago ( another Zeffirelli production ) that was ruined as a spectacle because the princess was played by a lady who was the size of a hospitality tent ( and was n't a great singer either ) . Strangely , in this production , it 's the male leads who raise an eyebrow ; they are middle-aged , overweight and visually unconvincing , and this does diminish credibility , given Zeffirelli 's emphasis on the `` look '' of a production ; it 's difficult to see how Jose and Escamillo could , in modern parlance , `` pull '' women like that ! OK , maybe the latter 's fame is a factor . As for the singing , the sopranos excelled , Berti was fine , Acelo middling , and one or two of the supporting singers pretty dodgy . Conductor and orchestra were good.As another reviewer remarked , it is not difficult to believe that every family in Verona was represented on the massive stage , plus quite a few tourists . There were more horses on stage than run in the Grand National , and I think I saw my dog , which had been let out to take itself for a walk , in one of the scenes . No elephants though . And yes the constant searching of the male singers for the conductor 's cue was irritating , but with so many people on stage , it 's a mercy they did n't have to jump up in the air to get the beat.But these are cavils . I really enjoyed the performance , more as a show than as grand opera . I think my dog did too as he came back very late .
