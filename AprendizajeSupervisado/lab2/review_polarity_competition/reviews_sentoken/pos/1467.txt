We acquired this collection because we wanted to own the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities . We just watched it and had a wonderful experience . The movie is very close to the plot , the performances are superb . Charles Dickens ' book will forever be a testament to the struggle of humanity between the have and have nots.The performance of Blanche Yurka , as Madame DeFarge is outstanding . The citizens of France , seeking to put an end to the tyranny they experience from the oppressing aristrocracy , presents the never ending example that when rights are stepped on , it always ends in revolution and change . The Marquis St. Evremonde , played by Basil Rathbone , provides a view to the horror it represents for anyone to show they do not care about those who suffer . Especially when it comes to children ; for the horror committed against this family , sparks the fire that leads to events that put an end to the ruling society.Dr . Manette 's performance as the innocent man who was a prisoner at the Bastille for over 18 years is superb . His daughter , played by Elizabeth Allen , represents the person that inspires great love in two men , one Charles Darnay , and Sydney Carton , superbly played by Ronald Colman.The character of Miss Pross , played by Edna May Oliver , is awesome . We go from disliking her , to admiring and then loving her for her sacrifice that saves the life of Ms. Manette . In the end , the sacrifice made by Sydney for the love of Lucie is one of the most sensitive and touching of all love stories . He finds purpose for his life , knowing full well that his actions shall forever live in the hearts of those he sacrifices for . Would highly recommend owning this DVD . The other movies shall be reviewed as we see them .
