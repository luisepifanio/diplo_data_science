let me first say that this is a great video . i love watching it . everytime i do i want to go outside and try something new . it also made me want to find out about parkour generations as an organization . the more i watch the more interested i become.the film is basically a documentary of the members of this group and some of their training sessions in different locations . it 's well put together and i love the music . there is alot of content on the dvd so there will be alot of stuff to take in . there are alot of good ideas on how to train and unorthodox workouts that the teachers take the students through . so , for that aspect , you could n't ask for more.the only complaint that i would have is that it is not a step-by-step presentation on training . there is no progression from this skill to the next . i really thought i was buying something more like that . so in that sense , i was a little disappointed . there is a video produced by american parkour which is specifically for introduction to parkour training . i 'll probably get that one too.but this one is really cool because i feel like there is a connection to the roots of parkour in france and it helps me have a better overall feel for the art .
