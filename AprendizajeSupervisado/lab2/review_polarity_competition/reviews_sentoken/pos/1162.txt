If you enjoy great bel canto singing , it does n't come greater than this.To add to the joy , Dessay , Florez and Pertusi not only sing their roles to perfection , they look their parts and act them superbly as well - and entire supporting cast do too . I have watched this video at least a dozen times over the past few months , and it only grows more delightful with each viewing .
