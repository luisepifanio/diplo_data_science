This perfomance of Ben Folds Five really made a fan out of me , It is truly amazing how many differe n't musical styles and sounds that can come out of only three musicians live . I must admit I was only familiar with the song & quot ; Brick & quot ; but that was enough of a reason to buy this DVD and give it a chance and to my surprise every song on here is AWESOME ! the picture and sound quality is perfect and the performance is enough to make an instant fan out of anyone . So if you 're into Rock , Jazz , Polka or whatever , this one is a MUST !
