The last Samurai is a very good film that falls just short of being great.That should not take away from the fact that it is one of the year 's ten best films or that it contains one of the year 's better performances in the form of Ken Watanbe , whose portrayal of a loyal Samurai leader is amazing as he draws you in to his world and culture . You can see why Tom Cruise follows him into his ways . This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance . The only problem I have with this film is how self important it is . Even films of this magnitude should not tug so hard on the epic strings . We get the point that this is a big historical epic . No need to keep implying it . However , this film is still worthy of some awards and a good audience .
