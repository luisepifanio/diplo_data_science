I 've had a Columbia VHS copy and a previous DVD edition of this great film and this is by far the best print I 've seen . In the past the image was faded , the black and white contrast was lacking , and the sound was rough . This new version from SHOUT ! uses a very clean print of the film . If you 've never seen this film , you owe it to yourself to pay the small price of $ 10.00 and check it out . BTW , the small price in this case also means no extras at all ; not even a Hope bio screen shot . But to me , having the quality print and audio is worth no extras !
