Michael J . Fox would not be Michael J . Fox without his starring role as Marty McFly in Back to the Future . This movie after 15 years still endures as we ca n't wait to see Flying cars , or time travel back to when our parents were courting . This movie is a classic of all time . If you have not seen this movie , please check it and part 2 and 3 out . A true trilogy , but every film does hold its own . Great casting of Christopher Lloyd to play the senile and crazy Doc Brown who invents time travel . I memorized all the lines from this movie and say them to friends all the time . & quot ; Hello , McFly ? & quot ; & quot ; What are you lookin at butthead ? & quot ; & quot ; Lorraine , I am your density . I mean your destiny. & quot ; Great movie , great cast ( including BIFF ) and a movie I watch over and over and over . I ca n't get enough .
