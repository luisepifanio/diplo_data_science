I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable . The story line is simple and , in some way , rather unimportant - Camille , a well-known Parisian actress , is returning from Rome to act in front of her home audience in a play directed by her new lover Ugo . The play is Pirandello 's Come Tu Mi Vuoi , a classical work ( written for his lover Martha Abba ) about a woman pinned between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion . Throughout the film Rivette switches his camera between the play and Camille and Ugo 's `` reality '' as if to ask us who are the real Camille and Ugo . What do they really want ? What makes them tick ? Can I , the spectator , enter their scriptless universe ? Rivette ( and his excellent actors ) show us that delicateness can be robust and inventive , that desire for another can never be fulfilled and yet that the fulfillment does not really matter , because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative . What matters is style ; style is substance . We are also treated to a brilliant depiction of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French and there is a delicious succession of nuances , hints and plays with the national stereotypes that brought many a smile to my face . I can see why some - those used to Hollywood cliches with their happy endings and oh so predictable plots - might not find the movie to be that hot . Well , that 's just too bad ... .
