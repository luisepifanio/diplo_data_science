I have a life-long love affair with Inspector Morse . Now that I am 81 years old , I still have that love but can not watch it anymore because it is not sub-titled for hearing impaired . When is it going to be subtitled ? The youth of today does not appreciate mysteries or movies like this . It is wasted on them . Only the older generation will want to spend that much money on this series but it is the older generation that needs it to be SDH in order to revel in it again . Please take heed and do something about this . Thank you .
