Dumas ' stories have been filmed so often , yet it still is a joy to see them . This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception . It has serious flaws and errors , too numerous to list . For example : modern language lines , totally unbelievable interpretations ( as other reviewers mentioned ) , very amateurish characterizations ( the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his nearly unchanged looks ) . None of these things really disgusted me . I just sat back and enjoyed . The opening scene set a mood and the photography generally showed fine settings . The very end was incredibly sappy , but since I had just watched a wonderful fighting/fencing scene with a lush green setting , I did n't care too much.A strong complaint I have about most new movies : the voices are almost inaudible compared to the background music and noises.I hope you will read the book , if you have n't already . No film ever has done Dumas ' story telling power justice . The Three Musketeers film version with Michael York as d'Artagnan came close.If you 're willing just to be entertained , this movie may fit your mood . I saw it three times by now .
