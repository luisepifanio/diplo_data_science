The recurring question asked by the police detectives showing the photo of a boxer as they engage in the massive manhunt for the murderer of a young Manhattanite woman . This is one of the seminal film noir pieces , showing the seamy side of NYC as the police , headed by Barry Fitzgerald , try to figure out just why Jean Dexter was found in her bathtub , but not as a drowning victim . We go deeper and deeper into the morass of immorality among some city denizens -- Jean does n't seem like a very nice girl , but someone has to be brought to justice for her death , even if it means the chase leads to the top of the Williamsburg Bridge itself . Filmed on gritty location in NYC just after WW2 , & quot ; The Naked City & quot ; still delivers after 50 years . Make it a point to check it out .
