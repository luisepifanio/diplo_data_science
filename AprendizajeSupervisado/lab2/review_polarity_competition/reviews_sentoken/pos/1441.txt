Some people in Germany have accused this movie of attempting to `` make harmless '' the crimes of the Third Reich . This could n't be further from the truth , and I 'll explain why.Bruno Ganz plays Hitler the man . Hitler the man who loves his dog , who is nice to his secretary , who loves his friends and spits at the people he thinks betray him , who tells those he cares about to save themselves even as he prepares to take cyanide , shoot himself , and then be burnt . This is a guy who , as long as he 's not talking about the Jews or world domination , would n't be that hard to live with.HOWEVER , this is still Hitler the monster . Being a vegetarian does n't absolve him of being directly responsible for the deaths of millions or for throwing the entire world into war . Hitler the two-dimensional monster is inseparable from Hitler the three-dimensional man , and that is what this movie reminds us every time it makes you feel sorry for him even though you know , and the movie reminds you , that he was a monster.All monsters in history -- past , present , and future -- were and are and will be human beings . We like to imagine Hitler as being some sort of inhuman monster , but he was only human . Far too human . That is why this movie makes people uncomfortable ; it reminds them that any 'gee he seems like a nice fellow ' leader of men could turn out to be a monster if the right questions are never asked or the ideas never challenged . The warning is an uncomfortable one : you can not trust any ideologue on face value.Not a single one , ever.And /that/ is the real import of this movie , if `` Never Again '' is to have any sort of real meaning beside a catchphrase . Were I a history teacher , I would show this movie followed by /Schindler 's List/ . Both are equally true , and equally important sides of the story : all this horror is from mere humans borne .
