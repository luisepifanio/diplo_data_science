This is one that is definitely worth getting on Blu-Ray . Images are sharp and crystal clear , John Barry 's famous soundtrack is in stereo , and there are four extras that are very informative . I 've been a fan of this move for decades , and owned it in VHS and two DVD versions . But the Blu-Ray is worth the money -- a simply superb edition of one of the greatest action/adventure movies ever made .
