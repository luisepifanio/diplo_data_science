This is an incredible DVD ! The magic of techniques between Steve Bailey and his three-finger false harmonics and Victor Wooten 's thumb and tapping styles combine into a fantastic jam and workshop . They jam together in front of a small and intimate audience along with drummer Greg Bissonette ( a perfect fit between the two ! ) and then go back the the studio and break down exactly how to play what they did . The interaction between the two is priceless , especially for anyone inspiring to play bass . Its THE most informative and equally funny and entertaining production I 've seen . The songs are especially perfect for showcasing both of the virtuosos unique styles . Limber up your DVD player , because it will be going back and forth and in between to catch an unbelievable performance and invaluable lesson . First Class ! Thanks Steve , thanks Victor !
