Of the three Flash Gordon serials , the Trip to Mars is my favorite . Ming , for unexplained reasons has escaped death on Mongo and landed on Mars [ which bears an uncanny resemblence to planet Mongo ] . He is nasty as ever . I really , really hate that Ming ! I have a confession , however . I am really , really in love with Azura , Queen of Magic ! [ I do n't want that to get around ] ! For some reason , she presented me with my first prepubertal sexual awakening . I was eight . It may have been her glacial beauty , her imperious disdain or her ability to turn grown men to clay and vanish on the spot . I do n't know . She died in chapter 13 . It 's an ignominious death in a tacky suburb of Mars . Even worse , it was at the hands of her own guards . I only know , had I been there , it would have turned out differently ! The computer has presented me with magic beyond her dreams . I could obtain this DVD and perform a search for my Queen . Queen Azura was played by Beatrice Roberts . The actress was born in Manhattan in 1905 . As a young woman she entered several beauty contests including Miss America . She had a short term marriage to Robert Ripley [ Believe It or Not ] , and a long term dalliance with Louis B. Mayer [ MGM ] . She appeared in a string of grade B [ maybe C ] movies , often uncredited . I still bear a torch for her . In truth she would be as old as my grandmother . On the screen , however , she retains a regal appeal . Beatrice Roberts vanished finally into obscurity and apparently is buried in Plymouth , Massachusetts near my hometown . If I ever find her grave I 'll stop and plant some violets .
