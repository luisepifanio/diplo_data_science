Beware ! buy the laserlight copy not the Madacy one ! ! I bought the latter first , and it 's awful . The Laserlight edition & quot ; rescues & quot ; the film into full splendor . A sensitive tale , based upon the Hemingway novel , an directed by the romantic director par-excellence , Frank Borzage . Felt performances by both stars , and an excellent supporting cast . A vintage experience .
