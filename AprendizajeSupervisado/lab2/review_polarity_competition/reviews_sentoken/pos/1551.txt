This dvd is really great for people who want to tone up . Unlike the 30 day shred , NMTZ have substantially lesser cardio ( just a little bit in the warm up section ) , which is what I really like about this dvd . The dvd is broken down into sections and u can choose which muscle groups you want to work on . What I like is that she mentions that you can not spot reduce , but can work on every muscle to shape up . You can also play the entire set which is 40 minutes long . This is meant for intermediate to advanced exercisers . [ ... ] I really liked it .
