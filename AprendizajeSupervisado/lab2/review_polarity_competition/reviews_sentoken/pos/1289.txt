Zatoichi Vol . Four is as good as the first three volumes . Like some of the other episodes they do tend to be simular to some of the films . Despite this , the series is excellent . You forget your watching a tv show and you are immersed into the continuing story of ichi . I am so happy that these are finally coming out on dvd , slowly , but being the huge fan of Ichi that I am , I could n't get enough with the 25 of 26 films available . Where 's # 14 ? ? ? ? My only complaint is that media blasters would release the series by seasons and not volumes . The 4th vol is still season 1 . There are 100 epsiodes to the series and with only 4 or 5 on each vol , well do the math that 's a lot of volumes . If you like the films and you are a fan of samurai cinema , these dvd 's are a must have .
