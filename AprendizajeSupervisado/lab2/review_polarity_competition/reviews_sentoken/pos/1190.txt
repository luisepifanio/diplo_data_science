This one passed UK cinemas by VERY quickly , getting some fine reviews , but no audience . I read a bit about it , then rented it when it came out . I was totally floored , even though i expected it to be good , it blew me away . I had to rent it again a couple of days later to show my friends . Then a couple of days later again . I have bought the film 3 times on DVD , as i keep giving mine away to try and spread the word about this amazing film . It 's best not to know too much , just check it out . Brilliant ! ! ! !
