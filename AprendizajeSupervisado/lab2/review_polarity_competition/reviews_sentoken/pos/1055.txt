There 's something about Mary probably is the most movie from the Farrely brothers and also the most successful but Kingpin is the best . It is very funny with wonderful casts ( Woody Harrelson , Bill Murray , Randy Quaid and the lovely Vanessa Angel ) . About down on his luck bowler ( Woody ) who coach a naive amish bowler ( Randy Quaid ) to win $ 1,000,000 winner takes all bowling tournament in Reno , Nevada . It is non-stop laugh for 2 hours . Bill Murray is especially good in the role of a sleazy bad guy and Vanessa Angel deserved to be a major star . She is both beautiful and talented . The DVD gave you both full screen and Wide Screen versions of the movie with enough extra features . The picture is very good and The Dolby 5.1 is fair . Get this DVD . You wo n't be sorry . Highly recommended .
