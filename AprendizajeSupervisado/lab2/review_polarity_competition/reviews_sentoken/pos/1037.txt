William Friedkin 's `` The Exorcist '' is a landmark . The cultural psyche still is still reeling from its arrival on the scene over thirty years ago . It is a masterpiece that will continue to endure long after many horror films of today are forgotten.Actress Chris MacNeil ( Ellen Burstyn ) seeks the aid of Father Damien Karras ( Jason Miller ) after her daughter Regan ( Linda Blair ) starts to behave oddly . Upon the realization that something is horribly wrong with the young girl , Father Lankester Merrin ( Max von Sydow ) is summoned to conduct an exorcism on her . A terrifying battle between the forces of good and evil then ensues that pushes all involved to their physical and spiritual breaking points.Words can not effectively convey the power of `` The Exorcist . '' This is a film that relentlessly assaults the senses and makes no apologies for doing so . Genre entries that followed it had no choice but to follow its lead because it single-handedly redefined what the public understood to be cinematic horror . While Linda Blair deservedly receives much of the attention for her fine work , the equally powerful performance by Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked . He gives the film an important human component that keeps it grounded . Without Karras ' arc , `` The Exorcist '' is just another scream-flick trying to make a quick buck by relying on cheap thrills . Truly groundbreaking , `` The Exorcist '' is a stunning work that dared to test the limits of filmmaking . No serious discussion of great cinema is complete without a mention of it .
