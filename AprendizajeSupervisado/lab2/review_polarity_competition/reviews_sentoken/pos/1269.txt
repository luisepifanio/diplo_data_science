When I first came across Across the Universe , it looked a little esoteric , even with the musical pedigree of the Beatles . But from the first minute when Jim Sturgess sings `` Girl '' - it all makes sense . You have to really respect how well the Beatles ' musical legacy has been woven into this effort . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Starr made some of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a nice movie , Across the Universe really puts that into focus . The power of the songs comes alive at every turn.Vividly imagined with beautiful art direction and cinematography , Across the Universe expertly weaves the Beatles into the socio-political context of the times the songs were written in . Hats off to director Julie Taymor and team who clearly thought this out very well , and the excellent cast who all sing better than anyone would expect . This is quite a feat , considering that it could have come off cheesily or poorly done . Actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney but that 's where the resemblance to anything Beatles ends.It 's a pity Across the Universe did n't succeed as well in the theatres , but I suspect that the treatment may have been too intelligent for today 's audiences . It 's a movie that comes from the heart that every Beatles fan should watch and those curious about the music can check out .
