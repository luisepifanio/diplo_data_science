These DVDs have catapulted our sex life . My partner and I have found each other 's `` buttons '' and are having a great time . Since viewing the dvds , one of the things I love to do is to peak her , and I 've gotten pretty good at sensing when she is at the top and desperate to go over . She seems to love everything I do during this time , and one of my favorite things is to keep her at that moment of intense desire for as long as possible , and as close to going over as possible , before letting her down , or go over.These techniques have answered questions I had for a long time about how to please her - only to bring about MORE questions that I did n't even consider before . We have become VERY interested in exactly what it is she wants , every time we have sex together . My most recent question is this - do women prefer to rise slowly , and then drop down a little several times , or would they prefer to remain at the brink for extended periods of time ? From my perspective , the higher she gets and the longer she stays there , the more gratifying it is for me . When I ask her what she likes , it appears to be whatever I did at the time . I 've heard keeping her at the brink called `` sweet torture , '' and I 'd love to have a woman 's perspective.Like I said , we are really in to her sexual pleasure , and I attribute this rekindled interest in part to the techniques given in the videos . Highly recommend , but ONLY if what you want is a super-charged sex life ! ! !
