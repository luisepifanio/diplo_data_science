This is the toughest weight exercise tape I have done . Leave it to Karen Voight to produce an 85 minute killer . Also , leave it to Karen Voight to produce a video jam-packed with interesting combinations compiled in such a way that the workout flies by . Karen Voight is top in her field for a reason . Her incredible cueing , her instructions and the exercises themselves work amazingly well . This video is no exception . Working the enire body , Karen concentrates on specific areas , but keeps the entire body moving throughout the video . Although the background is a bit dated as well as the flowered leotards , the workout is not . My only gripe is that she talks over the music in the background ... .the music would be good if it was more than muddled backgound noise . But the workout is so complete and novel , that this flaw can be overlooked . Truly another killer by Karen Voight !
