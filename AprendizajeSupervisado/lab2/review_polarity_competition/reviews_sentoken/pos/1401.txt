Iggy 's performance is great , highlighted by 5 Foot One , but what 's really cool is listening to his interview with Tom Snyder . His front tooth is all rotted out , and he 's a little discombobulated after performing Dogfood , but he 's a great interview . Hilarious , insightful , and smart.Iggy 's interview is a welcome treat after watching the painful interview with John Lydon who is typical John Lydon . Standoffish , horrible rotting yellow teeth , surly , terse , and difficult . No music from PIL , though , just interview.The Plasmatics put on an entertaining show . At one point the guitarist goes through the audience and completely falls on top of a senior gentleman who probably did n't realize which show he had gotten tickets for . Another old lady has her fingers in her ears . Plasmatics blow up a car . Wendy O comes across as very sweet and somewhat shy during her interview with Snyder , the antithesis of her character on stage and in Reform School Girls ( **** ) .Ramones are always good . They 're not interviewed by Snyder , though . He was on vacation that week.The punk roundtable from '77 with Joan Jett , Paul Weller , Graham , etc . is interesting to listen to and to see where music went from there . Kim Fowley ( the producer , manager , etc ) looks like a complete jacka $ $ but adds considerable entertainment to the whole discussion.Overall , the sound quality on this DVD is n't spectacular . Bass is thin , and vox often overshadow the instruments , but the performances more than make up for this . It 's a total nostalgia trip to watch the episodes in their entirity and is often hilarious . Funny how some of the same topics in the media today ( violence in sports , the economy , Ricky Schroeder ) were the same stories they were talking about back in the early 80 's .
