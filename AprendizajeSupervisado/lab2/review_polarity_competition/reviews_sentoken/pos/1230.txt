This movie made me cry so much and was so sad that it is really difficult to understand how I could recommend it so strongly.The chemistry between Nicholson and Freeman was incredible and they played off each other beautifully . The humor was a welcome relief to the immense emotional subject matter.This movie really made me think about what is important in life . I found several of the key themes in the movie something to think about and consider with respect to my own life . I loved the questions from the pyramids:1 . Did you find joy in your life ? 2 . Did you bring joy to others lives ? This movie probably is n't the one to reach for when you are in the mood for something light-hearted and funny . However , if you want to regain some perspective about what is important in life , this movie does a good job of making you think about what you want to accomplish in life -- particularly without being preachy .
