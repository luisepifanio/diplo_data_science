I really enjoyed this movie , and would give it 20 stars if I could . I highly recommend it . The musical numbers are great and so is the story . Jane Powell and Fred Astaire dance beautifully together . They do n't make them like this anymore.The colors , scenery and costumes in the numbers are great too !
