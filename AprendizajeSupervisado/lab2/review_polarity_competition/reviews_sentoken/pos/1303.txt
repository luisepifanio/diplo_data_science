The wooden box is a litle hokey , but it 's what 's inside that counts , and what 's inside this wooden box is a must-have for every serious Morse fan.This has to be one of the best TV detective dramas that the Brits , or anyone else , have come up with . Colin Dexter 's stories are well written , and the characters adapt well to the screen thanks to the excellent acting of the late John Thaw . Morse is a sometimes sad , yet always admirable character . Kevin Whately , as the often painfully naive Lewis , is the perfect foil to Morse 's intellect and love of culture.The individual plots offer the usual share of twists , turns , and red herrings in order to keep you guessing , but the stories are not pretentious in their complexity.If you enjoy solid detective dramas with a healthy dose of English culture , then this series is right up your alley .
