This is an unusual Merchant/Ivory film that focuses on the Indian community of Trinidad from 1943 to about 1954 . It focuses in particular upon a young teacher , who takes a wife , outfoxes her wily , grasping father , and lives in the country , desiring only to write books . Still , he has to earn a living , so he becomes a masseur , which is not a masseuse , but rather , a healer . He also writes a books on Hinduism , which he publishes himself . He becomes known as the Mystic Masseur and develops a country wide following.His book and those books that follow are quickly bought up by a now adoring public who revere him as a Pundit . A brief career in politics soon follows , only for him to discover that an adoring public can turn fickle . The film meanders along , as does this pundit 's life . With first rate cinematography and stellar performances by the entire cast , this is a very good , though unusual , film . Those who are interested in other cultures will find this film of some interest . If you are not so inclined , deduct one star from my review .
