A Better Way To Die is a action-packed , dark-comedy about a ex-chicago-cop named `` Boomer '' who quits the force after his partner is killed in a undercover drug bust by ruthless gangters , and desides to go up north to wire things up with his estranged girlfriend , but on the way he gets robbed , shot at , beaten , framed , and his girlfriend killed in the process , and is mistakenly identified as a missing FBI agent the Chicago mob and corrupt FBI agents are trying to track down which leads Boomer to a quest of bloodshed and revenge . A Better Way to die is the best action-packed film of the year 2000 , and its dark humor and hilarious gun fights and wo n't leave viewers disapointed . I highly recommend A BETTER WAY TO DIE .
