I watch a lot of documentaries on health , fitness , etc . What I really liked about this particular movie is that it is so effective without resorting to shock value . The examples are extremely motivating . What started as initially an extreme juice fast , turned into very doable in just an hour and a half . My next purchase will be a juicer !
