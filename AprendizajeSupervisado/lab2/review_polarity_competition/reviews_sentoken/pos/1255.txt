This movie has all the makings of a classic . Great Sci-Fi with a turn the tables story that is compelling and engaging . Just enough in the way of special effects as to not detract from the story but to convey a future of both optimism and the terror associated with too much trust in technology and human institutions.In all , great storytelling !
