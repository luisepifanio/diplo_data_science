I Got this movie to watch with my wife . I was expecting nothing but the typical teen flick , starring one of Disney 's prefabricated Child Stars.Wow ! Zac Efron CAN Act ! Who would 've thought . This guy could turn into a HUGE star in the next few years and a Highly Respected actor if he makes good career choices . The movie was really good too . I was entertained the whole time and was n't bored for not even a minute.This movie reminded me a lot of Back to the Future . It was n't as good ( BTTF is a classic ) but it was a pretty good effort and a pleasant surprise .
