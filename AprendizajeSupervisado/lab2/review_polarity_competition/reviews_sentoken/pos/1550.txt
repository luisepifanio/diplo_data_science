I 've been watching this animated show for the past 10 years , I 'm 20 now . I honestly can say I still ca n't find one thing wrong with Gargoyles . With an engaging story , loveable cast , and wonderfull music I give this show a 2 thumbs way up . I 'm glad , after 10 long years I can finally have the gargoyles in my home . BRAVO Disney !
