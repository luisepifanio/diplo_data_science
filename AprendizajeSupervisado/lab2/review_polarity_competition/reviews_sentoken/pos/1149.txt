This particular detective series stands above the slew of whodunnits . There 's only one other detective series in its class that comes to mind - and that is the Sherlock Holmes series which starred the wonderful Jeremy Brett . There 's something terribly interesting about the relationship between Lynley and Havers . It 's always strictly platonic and professional , and yet , it 's something more ... .a friendship . I affectionately refer to Havers as Lynleys ' 'work spouse ' . Those familiar with the series , and newcomers , will find that to some extent this is true . Friendship aside , there is much hard core detective work in this series . I enjoy Lynley and Havers brainstorming sessions and even their arguments , which can be scathing . I have to mention a word about the actor Sharon Small . It needs to be stated that Ms. Small fits so seamlessly into the role of Havers , its almost unbelievable . Overall , this is a high quality and very entertaining detective series which only comes along once in awhile .
