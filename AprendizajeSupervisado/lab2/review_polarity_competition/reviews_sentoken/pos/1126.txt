This is my favorite movie on Bernadette and Lourdes . And now this new re-mastered , widescreen version just released by Ignatius has such a great , higher quality picture , along with so many bonus additions , including the first time availability of the French language ( original ) version , and the wonderful film and radio interviews with the wonderful Sydney Penny . Those interviews add so much to this film package . Its great to see & hear the lovely Sydney Penny in person talk about what it meant to play this role . ( This movie was actually filmed in both English and French , shot two times back to back by Jean Delannoy , and both versions are on this DVD . ) PLUS - the glorious voice of the incredible singer Jenifer Warnes and that deeply moving song she and Leonard Cohen wrote , `` Song of Bernadette '' , on the bonus CD in this package . Now hopefully many , many more people will get to hear this lovely song and tribute to Bernadette by this fabulous Grammy-winning artist . It also has a second beauty sung by Jennifer Warnes on the CD , her song `` Prairie Melancholy '' . Another music gem from this heavenly singer . In this 150th anniversary year of the Lourdes apparitions , this newly packaged re-mastered film , with the audio CD and songs , the Penny interviews , and the 16 page Collector 's Booklet , is such a wonderful way to honor the Lourdes story and this inspiring movie .
