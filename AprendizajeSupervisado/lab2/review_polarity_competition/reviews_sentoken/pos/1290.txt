I 'm not going to dwell much on the storyline or characters . I just want to say that this is one nail-biter right from the opening scene and is so much fun to watch . Sure it makes no sense if you 're talking about something like this happening in real life ( well maybe it does , but the bus would have exploded early on in its journey ) but for entertainment value , this movie is way up there on the scale . Dennis Hopper was a wonderful villain and the characters are very likable.I want to give thumbs way up for the audio portion of the Blu Ray - turn up the sound when you are watching this because the quality is truly stunning . Very realistic , nothing exaggerated . Dialog is clear and the movie makes good use of a surround system . The video is good , considering the age of the movie . The audio is just plain excellent .
