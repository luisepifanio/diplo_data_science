I ca n't recommend this program highly enough . For those of us new to yoga and for whom exercise is but a dim memory , this gently encouraging workout will have you hooked before you know it . Four levels of intensity are demonstrated for each pose . This accomplishes two things : 1 ) it does n't scare people away who ca n't tuck their ankles behind their heads just yet , and 2 ) it provides incentive to strive for the next level . For those who complain that this program is just so much eyewash , please remember the three areas a well-rounded exercise regimen should address : strength training , aerobic conditioning , and flexibility . & quot ; Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss & quot ; is an energizing way to achieve the latter while being , dare I say it , ... fun !
