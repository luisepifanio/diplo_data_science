This is a & quot ; chicks movie & quot ; , but really in the best sense of theword . This is a movie to purge the male thirst for & quot ; action & quot ; . Youhave to truly have a heart of stone not to enjoy this movie.Kate Winslet was I believe only 19 when she made this movie -what a performance . I found Hugh Grant 's performance a little toomannered , but Alan Rickman was excellent - as he is in just abouteverything he does - from the bad guy in & quot ; Die Hard & quot ; to ObidiahSlope in the BBC 's production of & quot ; Barchester Towers & quot ; .But the stand out performance is Emma Thompson 's , holding in allthat emotion . Truly superb . When she thinks Marianne is going todie and her inner resolve slips - that is truly some of the bestacting of our time.This movie is wonderful . And no one gets shot .
