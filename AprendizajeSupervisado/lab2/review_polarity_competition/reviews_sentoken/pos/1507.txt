I was always a fan of SOAP . It was upsetting to see the show go off the air . The only complaint I have is , one special episode was not included in the box set . Jessica went to a comma and ended up in heaven . An angel played by Bea Arthur famously for Maude Tv Show was reviewing Jessica 's life to see whether she qualified to enter heaven or Jessica may have to return back to earth . This episode was really a special broadcast 3 weeks before Season 4 began . It 's a shame , it should have been included in this box set for a complete set . They could have made it a separate menu . Interview of the cast could have been added to the disc as well . Other than that , It 's a must have in anyone 's collection .
