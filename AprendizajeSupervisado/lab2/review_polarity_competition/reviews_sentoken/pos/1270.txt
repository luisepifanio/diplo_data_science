It seemed for years that you did n't even have to be a tabloid addict to keep up with Britney Spears . Her antics were n't just spread all over EVERY magazine cover , but even make it to the national nightly news ! You also do n't have to be a genius to figure out that half the stuff in those magazines did n't seem quite right , though . Finally Britney shows us a little look into what it 's like to be the worlds most famous celebrity . Some critics say that it does n't really explain everything ( Why exactly did she shave her head ? ? How did this guy take control of her life ? ) she touches on most of the highlights , but the poor girl 's life is public enough - can we at least allow her to keep SOME secrets to herself ? You 're probably a Britney fan if you 're looking at this so I doubt I have to convince you that her music is awesome . I highly recommend this DVD not just because it 's important for fans , but it 's definately a historical video that prompted one of the biggest comebacks of all time.Get it !
