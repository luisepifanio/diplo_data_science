Dumbo is a classic Disney film , one which is iconic in its imagery of the pink elephants and the poor little elephant with too large ears to fit into the elephant society . This is a very sad and bittersweet movie as Dumbo is removed from his mother who pines away for her lost son . Dumbo has to find his own identity and find a way to not get picked on all the time.Originally released in 1941 , Dumbo is a short 63 minutes in duration . The special features on the Big Top Edition more than outweigh the feature itself . There is a game that teaches children about circus animals , a storybook , two sing a longs , a music video , several Disney shorts . Outside of the commentary track and the shorts , little here is of value or interest to the adult . The real issue with this new `` Big Top '' Edition is that it is not significantly different than the `` 60th Anniversary Edition '' . There is a different music video , the addition of a feature and the loss of others . The film quality itself is not dramatically different than the previous version.Honestly , Dumbo is a Disney film worth owning . But it makes no difference which edition one purchases.-Joe Sherry
