I 'm really enjoying using this DVD . I 'm 30 weeks pregnant with my second child and the calm and relaxing feel of the workouts is brilliant at the end of a long day with my toddler ! I feel very safe doing the exercises , even with my big bump , and it 's really made me think about my posture during pregnancy .
