First , I want to thank all the reviewers here . It is their reviews of this fine film that tempted me to purchase it ( that , and the fact that the director also did `` Breaker Morant '' -- a favorite of mine ) .I 'm a big fan of this genre . I loved `` Dances with Wolves '' and `` Jeremiah Johnson '' , and I really enjoyed `` The Last of the Mohicans '' and `` Last of the Dogmen '' , yet none of these excellent movies compare with the absolute realism depicted in `` Black Robe '' .This is a simple story set in the early seventeenth century ... a story of a French Jesuit priest who has been charged by his superiors to canoe to a Huron outpost 1500 miles away ( with the aid of Indian scouts and an interpreter ) and help convert the Huron Indians to Christianity , thus saving their souls . In this movie the protagonist is n't some superhero who makes no mistakes , shows no weaknesses , can out shoot and out ride any man alive . On the contrary , he is just a young priest filled with self-righteousness , ignorance , fear and doubt . But despite this ( or because of this ) , his bravery is truly unparalleled . This is a story of real people fighting for their lives every single day against the breathtaking harshness of nature and against other Indian tribes.This is also a story about the clash between two widely varied cultures . This is shown with an uncanny subtlety , yet the effects are devastating . `` Black Robe '' goes where few movies have gone before , or since . It is a movie as Oscar-worthy as any I have ever seen . The cinematography is bleak , cold , and unforgiving , as is the story . Between 1 and 10 , I give this landmark film a solid 9 . It truly is one of my favorites .
