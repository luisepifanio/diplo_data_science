As many reviewers put it , this is definitely a light-hearted , irresistibily funny , and just plain wonderful film to watch . No sex , no violence , just a funny story about a salaryman who finds dancing to be a key to liberate himself from his bored existence . The music soundtrack was simply wonderful -- each song matched each scene so perfectly . I was lucky that I was able to obtain a copy of the soundtrack during a trip abroad.In any case , I found the plot to be far more engaging and intelligent than your standard Hollywood films . Rather than having Sugiyama fall in love with the original girl that attracted him to the dance hall , he finds out the sheer joy of dancing and its liberating power that brought him closer to his family by encouraging him to display his affection and love more openly and directly . No cliches or well-used plotlines , just a beautiful story .
