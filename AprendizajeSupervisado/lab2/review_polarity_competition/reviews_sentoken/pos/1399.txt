.This movie depicts the reality of the how cold , hard and unfair life can be - yet gives us hope as well . I was a little nervous near the latter part of the movie that it was going to have a & quot ; Hollywood goofy ending & quot ; but a very surprising plot twist left me stunned . This is a superb story superbly told . This movie is what I would define what an excellent film should be . Film schools should require students to study and consider the methodology of this production . Here is proof a gazillion dollars and hi-tech hocus pocus effects are not needed to hit a home run . In fact I 'd say this movie is more like a grand slam !
