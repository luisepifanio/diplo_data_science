This is a little known but absolutely wonderful film that , corny as this sounds , deserves to be shared by many.A small film about a family and the small day to day trials and tribulations they go through.It 's very realistic and deals with the the most average everyday things.What makes this film so amazing is how it is able to present this window into the lives of this group of people with such wit and insight , sadness and honesty ; ultimately resulting in a film which is tender and uplifting and hopeful.Tha acting is simply awesome . No other words to put it.Everyone from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall to Marianna Jean Baptiste , to Claire Rushbrook , all take turns stealing scenes in performances that are so natural and on point that at times , it does n't even feel like they 're acting . This is true acting that cuts straight to the heart.The script is wonderful in that it provides so many little details that one would n't think to include in a movie . Just the smallest things which somehow bring the characters to life.A wonderful film that is never going to get any acclaim because this is all about the actors.No special effects or halle berry sex scenes . No way-this is an actor 's film.And they steal the show.If you have taste in REAL cinema , do not miss this gem of a movie.IT IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL .
