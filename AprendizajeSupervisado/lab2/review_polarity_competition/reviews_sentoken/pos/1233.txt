This cartoon was an is unlike any other produced by Disney or anyone else for that matter . It 's content is truly unique , and encompasses Shakespeare , real history , mythology , and has continuing plotlines and amazing characters . It 's appropriate and enjoyable for any age , from child to adult . It has a strong moral message but does n't browbeat you with it . I would recommend it to anyone .
