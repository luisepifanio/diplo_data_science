Here I am 50 years after the release of this film writing a positive review of it . The storyline is relatively complex for this era . It shows how a player gradually got caught up in something he never planned . His motives might even have been considered somewhat admirable as he had the interest of his girlfriend and little brother in mind in deciding , reluctantly , to get involved.The subtle nature of temptation is conveyed in that he is not called upon to lose any games , merely play poorly enough for them to be close . Marshall Thompson plays the lead role of Johnny Long . Sports journalist Pete Ferreday is played by John Ireland . The screenplay is written in such a way that the characters nuances come through . Felix Feist did a nice noir-ish type film . It all comes together in a way to hold your attention to the end .
