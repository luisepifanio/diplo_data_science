I have been watching so many movies lately that either make me cry or leave the theater with a disturbed feeling . Finally when I saw this movie it made me laugh . You do n't have to be a child to love the movie . I was just really happy and I had a good feeling leaving the theater . I will buy it when it comes out on DVD .
