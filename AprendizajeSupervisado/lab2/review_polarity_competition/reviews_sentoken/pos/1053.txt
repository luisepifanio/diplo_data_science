Wolverine and the X-Men was a fantastic adaptation of the X-Men for this generation . The episodes were seriously well-written and sometimes it felt like watching a Bryan Singer X-Men movie in animated form . Not only was it great action for the TV-Y7 rating , but the plotting was very mature and felt like a Toonami-style drama with some honestly heart-wrenching and exhilarating moments and it made this series awesome . It may be the best Marvel cartoon ever made . It 's disappointing that this show did n't get a second season , hence the name `` The Complete Series '' instead of `` The Complete 1st Season '' like it should 've been . I just hope that in the future , we 'll get to know what happens past the series finale cliffhanger .
