my wife and i enjoyed the series and intend to get the rest of the episodes.the people are real , the stories entertaining , and the scenery beautiful . we heard about it from my cousin , and on a recent trip to ireland , we visited the village where it was filmed . it is just like in the film.we recommend it .
