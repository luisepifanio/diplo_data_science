Of the numerous interpretations of this play that I 've seen on stage and screen , this is the best -- a strong statement considering the many excellent actors who 've been attracted to Tennessee Williams 's powerful characters ( e.g . Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston ) . John Malkovich seems to have been born to play Tom , the artist torn between familial duties and wanderlust . Malkovich 's intense and percussive style is an ideal match for Williams 's play , in which the text and its poetry dominate . His performance in this role is the most convincing of any I 've seen , and avoids the pitfall of allowing Tom to become too morose and self-absorbed . Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda , who , though deluded , narrow , and even stupid , holds her family together through her unique mixture of courage and desperation . Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have intended in the characters Laura Wingfield and the gentlemen caller , and the two generate real chemistry in the pivotal scene with the glass unicorn . This is a must-see for anyone interested in American theater .
