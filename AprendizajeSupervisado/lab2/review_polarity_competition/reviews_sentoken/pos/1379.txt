This outstanding , largely ignored 1975 film noir re-united star Gene Hackman and director Arthur Penn for the first time since 1967 's & quot ; Bonnie And Clyde & quot ; ( they also worked together on 1985 's & quot ; Target & quot ; ) . Hackman gives one of his career-best performances as a world weary P.I . who gets mixed up in a case of battling ex-spouses that quickly descends into the sludgier depths of incest , smuggling and murder . In the meantime , Hackman 's own marriage is floundering , and the script cleverly parallels this disintegration with the layers of deception and corruption exposed as he peels away the mystery of his case . The excellent supporting cast includes a very young Melanie Griffith , James Woods and Jennifer Warren . The film features an excellent jazz soundtrack ( a vocal version of the haunting title theme appears on Michael Frank 's & quot ; Art Of Tea & quot ; album ) . Intelligent , adult entertainment .
