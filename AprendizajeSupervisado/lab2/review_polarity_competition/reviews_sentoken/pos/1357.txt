THe miracle maker is an awesome telling of Jesus ' life here on earth . Forget the editorial reviews description of Jesus as brooding ( I do n't think they watched the movie ) Jesus is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes the way he lived . He was joyful in the message he had to share ! THis film gets that . It also shows how human Jesus was , how he struggled with the same things we struggle with . THat was the whole point of God sending him here and this film really captures it . My son & amp ; husband also loved it . It is more biblically accurate than any other telling of Jesus life I have ever seen including The Greatest Story Ever Told .
