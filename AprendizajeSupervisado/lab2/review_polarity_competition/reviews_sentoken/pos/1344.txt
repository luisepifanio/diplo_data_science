My seven year old son wanted to learn piano , so I bought a traditional piano book for children -- he ended up in tears . I was searching for a way to teach him which would n't destroy his passion and creativity , or steal his joy of learning . While walking through the library , the title `` Piano for Quitters '' caught my eye . Within days , my son was writing beautiful chord progressions and asking for `` music practice '' to be added to his daily work chart so he could play the piano before his other jobs were done . Our whole family is now learning to play the piano and loving it ! I am a former piano quitter -- I managed to survive one year of traditional piano lessons , and tried various other piano methods , but by using Piano for Quitters ( and it 's sequal : Piano for Life ) , I am learning to play beautiful music along with my children and husband .
