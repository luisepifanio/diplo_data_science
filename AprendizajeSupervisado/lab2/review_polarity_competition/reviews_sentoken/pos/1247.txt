The Dudley Moore version , which I saw in the theater years ago , was funny as I vaguely recall ( have n't seen it since ) . When confronted with the possible purchase of this movie , and the two different versions , I ended up choosing this much cheaper one ( got it used for $ 3.34 , including shipping ) on the chance that it would be at least okay and worth the purchase price . Wow , is this ever a great movie . I loved it . Very few movies get me to laugh out loud , and this one elicited a number of those . The original could not possibly have been better than this , and it 's so cheap . It 's like stealing . It is one of the gems of my DVD collection .
