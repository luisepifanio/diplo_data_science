I 'm not a a big fan of Ben Affleck or anything but I thought this was a fun movie with an original story.I have a hard time understanding the really low reviews others have given . Certainly I would n't expect it to bring in Oscar nominations but it was enjoyable . I rarely write reviews , but the negative reviews compelled me to add my opinion . This must be one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies because the ranking on Amazon is in line with other places , including IMDB .
