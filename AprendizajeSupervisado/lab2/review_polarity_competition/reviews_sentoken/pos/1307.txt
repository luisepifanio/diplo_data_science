Let me first say that as far as picture quality goes on this DVD , I would rate that with 4 stars . However , the content of this DVD makes up for the picture quality . Not that the picture is bad , I just feel that during remastering some of the clips could have been a lot clearer . With that aside , let me say that this is a super DVD to have in your collection . As of right now it is the only place you can find anything of & quot ; I Love Lucy & quot ; available on DVD , and this is the only place any clips of & quot ; Here 's Lucy & quot ; can be found . If you want to relive many of your favorite Lucy moments from the past , this is the place to go . Here you can find some of the classics like the famous Vitameatavegamin , or the candy factory , or even the time when Lucy and Vivian ( on & quot ; The Lucy Show & quot ; ) installed the shower and got stuck in it while it kept filling with more and more water . The great thing about this DVD is that it helps remind the viewer why Lucille Ball was/is as important as she has remained , and probably will be , to the television and entertainment world . I hope that the people at Paul Brownstein Productions start to release more rare Lucille Ball shows , such as her 1977 special & quot ; Lucy Calls the President & quot ; that reunited her with many of her costars like Gale Gordon and Vivian Vance . I think that we as fans need to let the companies that hold the rights to these shows know that there is a demand for them , and pass on the simple message that it 's & quot ; Time To Open The Vaults ! & quot ;
