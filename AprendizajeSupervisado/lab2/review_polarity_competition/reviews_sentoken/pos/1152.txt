This Review Is For Underworld In Its Blu-Ray Incarnation.I Have Just Finished Watching The Movie And All I Can Say And Think Is `` AMAZING '' ! ! ! The Picture And Sound Are Simply Incredible.This Is The Type Of Movie They Would And Should Use At An Electronics Store To Demonstrate The Advantage Blu-Ray Has In Both Its Picture And Sound Over Standard DVD.Not To Overlook The Incredible Story Line , Acting , And Computer Generated Graphics.This Was A Movie That Drew Me In From The Beginning And Never Let Me Go Until The End Credits Rolled.I Am Looking Forward , Now , To See The Sequel `` Underworld Evolution '' . If You Get Only One Sci-Fi/Horror Movie On Blu-Ray Give This Movie Serious Consideration.It Will Most Certainly Be A Movie I Watch Many More Times Then Once.I Would Rate This Movie 4 and 3/4 Stars If That Was An Option .
