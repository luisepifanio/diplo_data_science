I watched this dvd again the other day . I had n't seen it for about 2 years , since I first got it . I was having problems getting rid of a resentment I had against someone . I was so bothered by my feelings , I could n't sleep . Then I had the thought 'why not tap on it ? ' I popped in the dvd to refresh my memory on the simple technique . In a few minutes , I was tapping and feeling relief . Before I started tapping , my anger was about an 8-9 on a 0-10 scale . After a few minutes , it was down to a 2 , and then as the night progressed , my anger completely slipped away.I like and recommend this dvd because I got the visual that a book ( no matter how well written ) does n't provide.This is really amazing .
