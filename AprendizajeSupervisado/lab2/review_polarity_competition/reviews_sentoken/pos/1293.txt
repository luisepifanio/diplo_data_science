Long a fan of Irish music , I have turned to a series of artists to satiate my appetite . Bing Crosby and John McCormick have been succeeded by the Irish Tenors.This CD has a bit more of an Irish American theme as `` Isle Of Hope , Isle Of Tears '' and `` God Bless America '' illustrate . Interspersed among these tunes are traditional Irish tunes such as `` Macushla '' and `` Croppy Boy '' , along with newer songs , such as `` The Green Fields Of France '' and `` How are Things In Glocca Morra ? `` The singing is excellent , the words understandable . I appreciate the inclusion the lyrics of the songs contained on the insert of the cover . These are songs you will want to learn , whose stories you will want to research . I have . Listen again and again !
