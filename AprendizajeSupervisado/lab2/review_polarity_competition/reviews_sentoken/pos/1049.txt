Ok , the truth is that , while I love my son tremendously , I could never muster the level of enthusiam that these people deliver . My son loves this video , and I believe he has learned from it . If nothing else , he sees potty training as a positive thing , and that is worth the 10 bucks . The woman who narrates this video is almost heroic in her presentation . Buy it .
