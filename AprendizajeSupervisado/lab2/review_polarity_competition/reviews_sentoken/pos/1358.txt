Currently , this is the only version of Nobody 's Fool available on DVD . The fact that you get a Paul Newman doubleheader for the same price as a single title is just a bonus.Nobody 's Fool is one of my favorite dramas and one of Newman 's last great roles , as down-on-his luck Sully . The entire cast shines ; arguably , this is the best work you 've ever seen from Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis . Add to that a young , pre-Oscar-award-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jessica Tandy 's final role and you 've got a must see film and a treasure to own.I like Richard Russo 's books . I 'm fond of Mohawk , Nobody 's Fool and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Empire Falls . The latter book was translated into an HBO miniseries , Empire Falls , which surprisingly also includes performances by Paul Newman and Philip Seymour Hoffman . However , Newman won only one Oscar , Best Actor for his role in The Color of Money in 1986 . However , Newman exudes such casual charm as Sully in Nobody 's Fool that it remains my favorite of the two . Rating : Five stars.P.S . I 'm not a big fan of `` Fat Man & Little Boy '' . Unlike Nobody 's Fool , the historical drama does n't have the charm and humor I prefer for repeated viewings .
