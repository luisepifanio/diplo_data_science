Yes , my first copy had the audio problem , but the replacement played fine , so do n't be afraid to buy this fine introduction to an overlooked horror star . In his highly theatrical way , Tod Slaughter was as enjoyable as Karloff or Lugosi , and , as a few reviewers have noted , no actor ever had so much fun being Bad ( with a capital B ) ! FACE is probably his best and BARN is his first ; both films are eminently watchable with good picture quality . So , give Europe 's Horror Man a chance ; if you love '30s and '40s fright films , chances are you wo n't regret it . I , for one , hope to see more Slaughter on DVD .
