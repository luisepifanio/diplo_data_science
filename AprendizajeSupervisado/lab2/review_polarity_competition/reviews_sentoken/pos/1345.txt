The Limey is probably Soderberghs best work , it bests Traffic and Erin Brockovich easily , only Out of Sight and Sex , Lies , and Videotape are close . The Limey is one of the only movies I 've seen where the stylistic chances the movie takes make the movie not just some self-indulgent art piece to be debated in film classes , but a poignant film that resonates and stays with you . Terence Stamp plays the main character Wilson as a tough sad English criminal that is trying to find out what happened to his daughter . His quest has genre underpinnings , but this movie rises above any genre label . A lot of credit has to go to Lem Dobbs script which sidesteps cliche and injects some worthwhile comedy into the mix . But the editing style of this movie is why I love it , it works in waves like memorys , its the only movie I 've seen that accurately shows how your mind can shift from one thing to another . Right about now , I 'm sounding like some chin-stroking art student hopped up on his own self-importance . But watch the movie and you 'll see what I mean . The best part of this movie is that it is sad , the ending is n't a huge twist or some copout , its just profoundly sad , and there are n't many movies that evoke that feeling in me today . I 'm done .
