MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT multi-movie packs are fairly priced and of good quality . These twenty unrestored public domain film transfers vary from very good to sometimes fair -- none are ever unwatchable.The `` legendary detectives '' in this DVD pack are all derivative movie serials of the 1930s and '40s . `` The Shadow '' was a half-hour radio series first broadcast 7/31/30 . Originally only the narrator of mystery stories , by 1937 `` Shadow '' Lamont Cranston ( now portrayed by a young Orson Welles ) had become an integral character in each episode aired . The program 's 24 year run ended the day after Christmas , 1954 . The three Shadow films here were first seen in 1937 , at the height of the radio show 's popularity . `` Bulldog Drummond '' was created in 1920 by British author Herman McNeile , who published under the pseudonym `` Sapper . '' The Drummond stories were directly influenced by `` noir '' detectives then popular in American fiction , and are considered the forerunner of James Bond . The half-dozen movies in this set that feature this character are all from the late 1930s . `` Dick Tracy '' was a comic strip crimefighter brought to life by the pen and imagination of Detroit newspaper artist Chester Gould , in October 1931 . Gould worked on the strips until he retired in 1977 . Other artists are still producing the stories 76 years after the series ' inception.In the comics , police detective Tracy wooed future wife Tess Trueheart for 18 years , finally marrying her on Xmas Day , 1949 . During that span , square-jawed Tracy came up against such legendary bad guys as B-B Eyes , Flattop Jones , Pruneface , Haf and Haf , 88 Keys , Mr , Crime , Sphinx , Pear-shape and Faceless Redrum.The Dick Tracy radio show aired from 1935 to '48 . In the movies Tracy was portrayed primarily by Ralph Byrd ( beginning in '37 ) . Byrd stayed with the series until it ended after a brief run on early television . `` Sherlock Holmes , '' the most renowned fictional detective of all , was the creation of Scottish author and physician Arthur Conan Doyle . The Holmes stories were published in various British magazines beginning in 1887 . Over the years Conan Doyle tried more than once to kill off the character , but public clamor made him reconsider . Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories starring Holmes and Dr. John Watson , his friend and cohort in adventure , right up until the knighted author 's death in 1930.MILL CREEK 's SUSPENSE ! 20 Movie Pack would make a fine companion piece to this DVD set..Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings found at a film resource website .
