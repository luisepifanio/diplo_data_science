Gran Torino is one of the best movies I have ever seen ! Clint Eastwood is a genius with his fantastic portrayal of a racist old man that you can not help but love , this movie makes Eastwood a legend in my mind . All the other actors and acresses were fantastic and I was in awe at how powerful the movie was . I ca n't express how great this movie is .
