This show is the best . I was slow to get into it , but now every thursday night I am glued to the TV waiting eagerly for the Office theme song and opening views of lovely Scranton . The characters are hilarious but very realistic . It is a comical , hilarious , but nearly realistic depiction of the american workplace .
