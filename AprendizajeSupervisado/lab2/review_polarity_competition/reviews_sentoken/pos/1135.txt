Robert Duvall shows some originality , in this captivating film . I say captivating , I couldnt turn it off , the dialouge was very realistic almost with a documentary edge , the action while not flashy or excessive had realistic grit , and I had to know how it was going to end . Being an artistic endevour you really dont know whats going to happen to our protaganist , hitman in the end . I throw the word original at this work for a couple of reasons . The main character , `` John Anderson '' played by Duvall ( albeit as the same cheracter we have seen him play before ) is a hitman with a difference , not to much macho posturing is used creating this vulnerable , aging , and somewhat regretful professional . He 's not regretful about the `` jobs '' he performed , but that as he nears the twilight of his life he has established no real roots . He does however now have girlfriend with a ten year old daughter , and his love for and devotion to this child shines through , as does Duvall 's love for the Tango which is so beautifully performed many times for the loving camera by very attractive Argentinians . Both young and old . The assasination plot takes a back seat to the Tango for a good portion of the film , and when Duvall brings us back to his whole purpose of being in Argentina we are as sorry as he to have to leave this wonderful dance behind . There are one or two moments where Duvall 's scenes could have been tightened up but I never felt these were very big negatives . All in all I would recommend this film to lovers of independent film , dance , and Robert Duvall fans .
