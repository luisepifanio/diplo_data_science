I could wax lyrical about this film for ever but I wo n't ! In my opinion , the greatest movie musical ever produced , 'The Music Man ' is lttle heard of in my native Britain . I caught it when it was shown on TV in the small hours of the morning around 15 years ago and have loved it ever since.Robert Preston IS Harold Hill and proves that he is a fantastic screen actor whose film credits are depressingly few - although if you have n't already seen it , check out 'Victor/Victoria ' . Shirley Jones gives a performance that , after 'Oklahoma ! ' and 'Carousel ' , shows that she CAN act ! All of the supporting players are excellent too , with emphasis on Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold ( again too few movie appearances ) as the Shinns , Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo and The Buffalo Bills as The All-Singing All-Harmonizing School Board.Working much better as a film than a stage show , Meredith Willson 's ode to his Iowa childhood is perfectly captured by Morton DaCosta , whose direction is as stagey as it was on 'Auntie Mame ' but which fits very well with the slightly unreal nature of the plot.Musical highlights are virtually every song but a short list would include 'Trouble ' , '76 Trombones ' , 'Marian the Librarian ' and 'The Sadder But Wiser Girl ' .
