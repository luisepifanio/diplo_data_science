My son absolutely loves the book I Stink ! , so when I saw this animated version available , I knew it would be right up his alley . The folks at Schoolastic have a great track record when it comes to animating classic children 's books , and this is no exception . I Stink was animated in a way that perfectly compliments the book 's illustrations , and Conan sidekick Andy Richter does a fantastic job giving voice to the `` all-attitude , all the time '' garbage truck . The animated version of I Stink is almost as huge a hit with my son as the book.The DVD also includes a few other animated adaptations that ( sort of ) carry on the garbage truck theme . Trashy Town is the only other garbage-themed story on the DVD , but with its simple animation and catchy `` chorus '' it went over really well . The others are hit and miss . Arnie the Doughnut was funny and a little disturbing ( it 's about a sentient pastry aware of his imminent demise ) , but The Beast of Monsieur Racine was just a little too weird.I 'd absolutely recommend the I Stink DVD to anyone whose child ( ren ) enjoyed the book . It 's a fun collection of animated stories , and a welcome break from Elmo , the Wiggles , etc .
