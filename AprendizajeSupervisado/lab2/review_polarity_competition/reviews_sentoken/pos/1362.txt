I had no idea Ganz had it in him to be this great until I saw him here as Hitler . Alexandra Maria Lara as his young and naive secretary is also very good . Cast is excellent . Director Oliver Hirschbieger deftly pulls it all together and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through -- even though we all know how the tale ended.The film gets under your skin and gnaws at your psyche long after you have seen it -- and that is some trick . How were the makers of this motion picture able to accomplish this ? By avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his murderous SS thugs as two-dimensional cartoon characters , instead they show the lot of them to be what they were : human . Mixed-up , misguided , fanatical , barberic , coldblooded mass-murderers -- and all in the quest for power ( that they never attained ) , but human none-the-less.What is sad here , as far as I am concerned , instead of encouraging his nation to focus all that energy on making the world a better place , because Germans , the German people , have given us so much more than fine cars and excellent beer and camera lenses ... Hitler and his thugs had their people squandering all that potential on causing destruction and mayhem , misery and pain ... for nothing.I realize quite a few Germans did n't care for Hitler and his loony notions ... only there was n't much they could do about it ( once he came into power and they saw where he was actually taking them ... straight to Hell ) . Any German who opposed the dreaded SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or in some camp somewhere to suffer the consequences.I always wondered what it must have been like for Hitler and his people down in that bunker during the final months/weeks/days ... This powerful motion picture shows you what went on -- and then some .
