This 90-minute DVD from PBS is somewhat misnamed , but still a fine , entertaining performance.PBS station WCTE in Cookeville , TN recorded a series of concerts in the `` Volcano Room '' at Cumberland Caverns , 333 feet below ground level . The DVD collects excerpts from performances by 10 musicians or bands that best fall under the title `` Americana '' . A few are what can best be described as `` bluegrass '' , including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the family group Cherryholmes . Singer/songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle 's son Justin Townes Earle ( both of who I love ) are better classed as `` Americana '' . The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass , while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything.Based on the age of both his appearance and the song her performs , I 'm guessing that - even though this DVD is dated 2011 , the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago . I could n't identify the others.The performances were recorded with a live audience and it 's sort of neat to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background , but because the musicians are so well miked , I 'm not sure it makes the sound any better , or different . There are no real introductions ; the performer is identified by a title on the screen . So there 's no filler here.I enjoyed seeing artists I know and love ( If you have n't seen the whitest Black Gospel singer ever - Mike Farris - this is your chance ! ) But I also discovered some new ones.I - for one - would love to see a follow up to this DVD.I hope you found this review informative and helpful.Steve Ramm '' Anything Phonographic ''
