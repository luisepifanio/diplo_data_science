If you have n't read the book yet , you are missing a lot of information crucial to understand what goes on in the film . In the other hand the has more non-stop thrilling action and twists than the movie , and the movie tend to be confusing without the reading.I have some objections to the film , first of course is that it lefts out some very important facts explained in the book , second the movie script have some differences with the original novel by Dan Brown : - At the beginning of the film you find Robert Langdon ( Tom Hanks ) signing his book in an event in Paris , while in the novel the book was published yet . In connection with this scene , the French Police pick him up at this event to go to The Louvre , while in the Novel it was very late and he was sleeping at the Hotel.- The whole sequence of escaping The Louvre was much more thrilling in the book , and was over simplified in the Film.- The suspected conspiracy between the Vatican and the Opus Dei has some twists in the book , and was totally change in the film . The relationship between The Vatican and The Opus Dei group is described with more detail.- There is a lot of missing information about Silas , the albino Monk.- Getting the security box from the Swiss bank was much more interesting in the book.- There was an additional Criptek in the book.- There are other crucial differences towards the middle and the end of the movie , but I do n't want to mention then , because if you have n't read the book or seem the movie I will be ruining the suspense for you.Finally , read the book , watch the movie , do n't listen to the critics , ... .. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE . Use your common sense and your reasoning skills.4 stars for the movie , 50 stars for the book .
