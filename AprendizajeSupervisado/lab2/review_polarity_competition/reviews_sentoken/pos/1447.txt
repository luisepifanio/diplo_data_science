Based on a true story , Nigel Cole 's CALENDAR GIRLS is a whimsical , touching , but sometimes trivial movie . Trivial only in that there are many moments when nothing of any real importance happens , and the crisis points are predictably maudlin and overdone . But a delightful cast still manages to entertain . The idea of 50+ ladies a la natural is hard to fathom , but these ladies are so elegantly attractive and the calendar poses so tastefully done , one ca n't help but get caught up when the calendar becomes an international success.Helen Mirren , long overdue an Oscar , brings her role as Chris , the instigator of the calendar , to a marvelous fruition . Ciaran Hinds ( Sum of All Fears , Lara Croft Cradle of Life ) is very good as her husband whose off hand comments to a sneaky newsman causes a rift in their marriage . Julie Walters ( Oscar nominated years ago for Educating Rita ) matches Mirren in her role as the widow whose husband 's death inspires the calendar . The other ladies , Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton especially , are all very accomplished in their performances.Not an earth shaking movie , but an uplifting one in that it proves that beauty is not relegated to the young , maybe the young at heart .
