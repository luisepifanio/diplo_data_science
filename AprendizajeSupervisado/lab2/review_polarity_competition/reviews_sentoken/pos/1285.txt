as a lennon fan , i was extremely reluctant at first to see this film . However after some prodding by beatles friends of mine who had seen the film , i decided to rent it and was astounded with how brilliant the film was . Everything from the casting to the directing was top notch . I really enjoyed jonas ball as well as the slew of impressive supporting actors who lended their keen talents to the screen . To me personally , aside from Jonas , who is fantastic , I found the psychologist and the taxi driver to be extremely talented supporting acts as well . All in all I found the Killing of John Lennon to be an extroardinary film and I recommend it highly .
