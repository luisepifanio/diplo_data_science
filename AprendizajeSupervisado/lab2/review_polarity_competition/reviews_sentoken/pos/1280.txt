The Iron Giant is a loose adaptation of a wonderful book of the same title , by Ted Hughes ( written in the late sixties ) . In the book the origins of the giant are unknown , and he is initially buried beneath the earth before being attacked and ultimately befriended . The enemy in the book , who becomes a common enemy to both the humans and the giant and the cause of their alliance , was a giant dragon-like creature ( as big as Australia ! ! ) who the giant ends up outsmarting.In the film , set during the Cold War , and presenting a wonderful portrait of the 50s atmosphere , the enemy is US -- and our tendency to fear what is alien , and to shoot first and ask questions later . I think that this is , in the end , more profound . Of course , the original author may have had some such allegory in mind when he wrote the original book , since the dragon from outer space ends up destroying and enveloping in darkness a large part of the planet , almost like a world war . But in that case is their alliance with the giant supposed to mean an alliance with military technology in order to prevent a world war ? In the film , the robot is just a cool robot from outer space , that human beings can choose to make a friend or to establish as an enemy.In any case , this is easily one of the best animated films to come out of the United States in the last decade ( and one of the others is by the same director , Brad Bird ) .
