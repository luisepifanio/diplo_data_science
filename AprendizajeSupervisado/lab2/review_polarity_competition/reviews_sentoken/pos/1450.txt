I really enjoy Lost Highway and have been waiting years for this 2008 DVD release . I avoided buying the previous 'import ' version due to the explicit consumer complaints regarding the quality of the transfer . My potential concerns regarding sound and picture quality were allayed upon viewing this new U.S. release . It looks and sounds quite good , bearing in mind the source material . The visual style of the film is sparse , simple , and high-contrast -- rendered with Lynch 's `` vague America '' aesthetic . The image maintains its integrity and the deep blacks employed do not suffer from noise often seen in older or poor transfers ; the colors are also solid for a DVD . The sound design is suitably moody , ambient , dark , evocative , provocative , and intersperses a fairly eclectic mixture of songs with the invaluable contributions of composer Angelo Badalamenti . There can be a slightly irritating difference in volume between Patricia Arquette 's near-whispering and , say , Rammstein -- but this is not an uncommon problem with DVDs . Otherwise it sounds pretty cool.I 'm not going to review the film but I will say the complete lack of special features is more forgivable for such an unusual , ambiguous , and artistic film as Lost Highway than any other movie I can think of right now . I tend to view this film the way I view abstract art : explanation is not only unwarranted but also largely undesirable . In other words , special features could be intriguing but I hardly miss them for a movie like Lost Highway .
