This is a dark , creepy , mystery movie in which the writer did n't get too far out there with the plot . Often in films like this , the writers make the ultimate mystery solution incredibly complicated and unrealistic . This film , on the other hand , is just complex enough to make it intriguing , while still scoring high on the realism index.As much as I liked this film , I will say that Sean Connery is one the key reasons . Without him , the film would probably lose a star . This is one of his best performances . F. Murray Abraham is also at his best , as the incredibly evil inquisitioner . Christian Slater is not bad . The other actors in the film seem to have been found from a traveling freak show or they had the best makeup artist ever . What an odd looking bunch ! The film does n't over-do the gore and depicts very little violence . Torture and murder typically happen off screen . The Catholic church definitely gets a black eye here . All of the monks and clergy ( aside from Sean C. ) are shown as being at least 3 of the following : evil , ulgy , sexually active ( straight and gay ) , and generally very dumb . However , I like to think that a lot of that is due the the century ( 14th ) that the mystery occurs in , and therefore things were much more primitive . Still , Catholics may be offended if they 're not already desensitized by every other film that features Catholic clergy.The mystery itself is a good one that should keep you guessing . Sean Connery is the only logical person in the movie , and he is your tour guide toward the solution . I enjoyed the film , as I think most will . Just manage your expectations , as this is a good film , but not one of the great ones .
