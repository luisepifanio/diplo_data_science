This movie starts with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council : `` In a way , we 're not producing chickens , we 're producing food . What this accomplishes is to produce a lot of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price . Let somebody explain to me what 's wrong with that . '' Well , this film does explain very well what 's wrong with that.The first point is that it is no good to treat animals as if they were mere *objects* . You 'll see chickens and beef up to their knees in their own droppings . You 'll also see chickens in their cages , not being able to carry even their own weight . The animals are kept all the time in the dark , including for us . It was very hard for the movie makers to obtain some footage from inside those chicken houses.The second point , linked in a way to the preceding one , is that our food can easily become contaminated with E-coli , due to the droppings the animals carry on their skin . That 's how food poisoning can occur in the slaughterhouse.Barbara Kowalcyk , mother of a 2.5 old year kid , lived through the most horrible experience anybody can suffer : the death of her child ... The reason : eating a ... hamburger ... `` We put faith in our government to be protected , but we 're not being protected at the most basic level '' , she says . This is not an inconvenient truth - although this movie was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title . This is an ugly truth.Can we do something about it ? Absolutely . `` You can change the world , with every bite '' . Switch to organics . Even better would be to connect yourself again with the source of your food , of what you are eating , of what you are putting in your mouth ! The best thing to do would be to get involved with a local farmer you know and can trust .
