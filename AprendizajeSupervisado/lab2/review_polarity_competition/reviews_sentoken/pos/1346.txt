This is one of those rare movies that completely capture teen girls in a funny and honest way . Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated out of high school . While Rebecca gets a job to try to get her own apartment and move forward into adulthood , Enid is still struggling to try to find her place in a new world . This is obvious by her reluctance to get a job and move forward . After pulling a prank on a lonely older man , she somehow ends up becoming a friend of his while breaking away from Rebecca.Enid is a character you sometimes get angry with but at the same time understand that she is having trouble moving forward in life and feel empathy for . She has a lot of talent yet no idea on what exactly it is she wants to do . So she turns to the outcasts such as the crazy old man who sits waiting for a bus that never comes and the older Seymour.This film is often sad but hilarious too . You are always wondering just where this film will take you . Even the end is the perfect touch though some might not care for it . Its a great film that is actually real and honest . These are not cardboard cut-out characters , these are real girls.In conclusion , it deserves all the buzz . You will like this if you enjoy smart , independent films that are n't contrived and actually have some real meaning . Brilliant !
