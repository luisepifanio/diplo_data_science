Among the best crime films of the 1970s . Michael Caine has had lots of memorable characters ( Harry Palmer being another one ) . Caine is vicious and unstoppable as Carter . Somehow , amongst all his evil doings , he still has a sort of charisma ( I would n't go so far as to say he 's lovable ) . I saw it as a double feature with Point Blank , but would play just as well with another film like Straight Time or maybe The Outfit . Thank goodness for a dvd with a widescreen transfer and special features ! This is one of those films that is just waiting to find more fans as its availabilty increases . Truly a classic . Carter is the prototypical bad , bad man .
