It 's what you have come to expect from the guys from Monty Python . It 's silly , irreverent , and utterly strange . Erik the Viking is a light hearted dark comedy , and even though that sounds odds those of you who have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail or The Life of Brian will understand . This will never be called a masterpiece of cinematography , acting or special effects . Then again it 's not meant to . The movie does accomplish what it sets out to do.The charm of the movie is all about executing some pretty silly situations . From Vikings flying off the ends of the Earth to Erik fighting a host of enemies thinking he is invisible . The special effect hardly rival that of other Python films made in the 70 's , and this one was made in 1989 . The performances from the Monty Python cast are not their best , however they are entertaining and satisfying . The thing is none of that is really important . Erik the Viking is a good , entertaining story with some thoughtful yet subtle observations on human condition and religion . Even the dark stuff ends up not being such a downer in the end.This DVD is really hard to find , and to make matters worse Sony put together a Director 's Cut , but so far never bothered to release it in the United States . If you have a region free DVD there is a Director 's Son 's Cut available in the U.K. so there is hope . If you do happen to find the rare feature-less U.S. release for any reasonable price I recommend getting it without question since Sony has made no announcements to do any reissues.If you are a Monty Python fan then by all means see Erik the Viking . Those of you who do n't get the whole Python-esque humor wo n't appreciate this either . If you like off the wall sort of humor mixed with some decent Norse mythical stories ( and are not critical of low production budgets ) then this movie should be a nice diversion from reality .
