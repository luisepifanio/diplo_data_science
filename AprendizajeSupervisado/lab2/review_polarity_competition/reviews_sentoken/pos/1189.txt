I saw the Stallone version of this movie first . I must say , I did n't hate it and I liked the music and the girl who played his neice . But then I sought out and found the origional with Michael Caine . This movie is far superior to the movie that 'Rocky ' did . This has become a personal favorite of mine and I think one of Michael Caines best performances . It definitely holds up even today . It is violent , unapologetic and just a damn good seedy crime revenge movie .
