I purchased this DVD as a stocking stuffer for my husband . We watched it together in preparation for an upcoming trip to Amsterdam . The movie , which chronicles the life and struggles of the Dutch painter , Vincent Van Gogh , was very well done and one of Kirk Douglas ' best performances . It was troubling at times due to a heart-rending depiction of Van Gogh 's serious mental illness . Other strong performances by Anthony Quinn , who played the painter Paul Gauguin , and James Donald , who played Van Gogh 's brother , added to the enjoyment of the movie . The film was visually stunning and one was able to see the evolution of Van Gogh 's art . I look forward to my trip to see Van Gogh 's art in person .
