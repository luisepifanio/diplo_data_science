This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith . It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here -- - they are still with us in spirit . It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God 's love . Louie Giglio is a Christian who 's spirit sends a loving message from his heart .
