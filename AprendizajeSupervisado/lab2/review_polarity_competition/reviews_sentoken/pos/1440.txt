The video and audio transfer of the aged DVD version is excellent . Although the original movie was shot with very little light , the Blu-ray versions is much better ( although not perfect ) .Interviews with the main actors ( 25-years later ) show up in the extras portion of the disc as well as lots of other interesting comments from those who shot the movie.This is one you will want for your collection .
