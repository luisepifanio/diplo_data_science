This is one of the most beloved movies by affictionados of the foreign film scene . Tati provided a brilliant link between the best of what the silent movie era and modern film had to offer . It is a relatively simple tale of a bumbling man on vacation on the coast of France . But repeated viewings , especially over the years , opens up more and more treasures that were heretofore unrecognized , like a classic novel . I would be surprised if anyone would rave about this film the first time they watch it . I certainly did n't . But repeat viewings over the years will give you an appreciation of this film that borders on worship . Every member of my extended family loves this movie , and everyone has there own particular reason . Some love it for its ability to perfectly capture a foreign time and place , allowing one to feel as if they themselves have escaped to the French coast for the afternoon . Some love Hulot 's awkward but endearing attempts at romance the best . Many love the brilliant sight gags that are laugh-out-loud funny no matter how many times you 've seen them . But regardless of what a viewer loves the most , everyone will feel a bond with Hulot 's character ( and , in turn , M. Tati ) that will last a lifetime . With this DVD , I can finally feel safe to loan away my beloved , grainy VHS copy . A movie classic by every meaning of the term .
