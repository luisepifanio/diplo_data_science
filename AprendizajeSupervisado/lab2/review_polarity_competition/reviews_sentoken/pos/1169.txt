`` These are the continuing voyages of the USS Enterprise '' in blu ray.Okay , we all know what Star Trek is about , so I 'm not going to go over the plot . I will say that the stories are very interesting , well thought out , well written , and well acted . I really like how Star Trek touches on the 'Human Emotion and `` Human Element '' .I want to talk about the blu ray transfer , and it 's outstanding . The image is crystal clear and sharp as a razor . I was honestly speechless watching it . I grew up with ST : TNG , and it was like I was watching it all over again . The colors are very sharp , and I could n't believe what I was seeing . I 'm always amazed on how colorful and vibrant the images are.When I was reading other reviews , there were a lot of complaints on the sound . UPDATE : It seems that the further you go into the episodes , at times , the worse it gets . One of the episodes sounds like it was recored in a bathroom , a lot of echo and muffled . Even though it 's not perfect , I 'm still glad I have it . ***UPDATE 10/6 : If you have the early set , you 'll have problem with sound on some of the episodes . CBS/Paramount is having a disc exchange . Just send them an e-mail to : phe.stng @ bydeluxe.com . They 'll ask for the code on the back of the disc on the inner right . It may be hard to see , but it 's there . It took them about a week to send me the replacements blu rays . ***Usually , I do n't care about extras when it comes to DVD , but this has a lot of them , and they 're fantastic.Now , for the price . Yes , it 's very expensive , but man , it 's worth it . I passed on buying the dvd and waited for the blu ray , and man , I 'm glad I did . It was worth the wait.If you know someone that 's a Star Trek fan , this is a must have for them . They wo n't be sorry to get this , and neither was I when I bought it . I ca n't wait for the rest of the seasons to come to blu ray .
