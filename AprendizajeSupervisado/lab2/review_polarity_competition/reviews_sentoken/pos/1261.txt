God this film really had my stomach in knots for it 's entire duration.As atmospheric films go this one is certainly a masterpiece.It is quite a chiller indeed and relies on mood and an eerie atmosphere rather then on sudden frights and violence . The film is set in an old house in Jersey shortly after World War Two.Nicole Kidman plays the landlady of the house , living there with her two children all the while waiting for her husband to return home from the war.At the start of the film three servants arrive to give assistance.These remain to be the only characters who really get invloved in the film.Nicole Kidman is excellent in the role as are the two young children.The children suffer from a rare condition where they ca n't be exposed to any strong light.This brings about the dark scenes where the film is alsmost entirely set in dreary candlelight.To prevent the children being exposed to any lights all the doors in each room must be locked and unlocked upon entry.Much of the film is spent with the panicky opening and losing of these rooms as there is some strange presence in the house.In many ways some of these scenes are quite reminiscent to scenes in The Sixth Sense.As the story unfolds the backgrounds to these servant characters begins to unfold also.It gives the film an unbelievably intriging feel which resulted in me feeling constantly on edge throughout it 's duration.You never seem sure at all as to where this whole story is leading-so the sense of mystery is quite unique.When ever they do leave the house the outside is covered with this almost surreal fog-again building up the atmosphere beautifully.It reminded me of those Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies that used to give me the creeps as a child.You just wish the sun would come out if only to lift the atmosphere temporarily to give the viewer a bit of a break from all this tension.The pace really gathers as the film reaches a very , very dramatic conclusion . Beautifully shot , really gothic , brilliantly acted and well worth viewing .
