Good movies about the & quot ; Great War & quot ; ( as WWI was known before there was a second one ) are few and far between . After & quot ; All Quiet on the Western Front & quot ; and & quot ; Paths of Glory & quot ; the list is pretty short . This film does n't quite live up to those standards but it 's still an excellent film.In broad terms , the film is fairly accurate in terms of its depiction of WWI combat . The battle scenes come as close to & quot ; Saving Private Ryan & quot ; level of realism as you can get on commercial television . Be warned that some scenes , especially the & quot ; friendly fire & quot ; artillery attack , are not for the squeamish.The supporting cast is a colorful and original collection of characters , devoid of most of the usual war movie cliches . You could n't look at a character and say whether or not he 'd be dead by the end of the movie . It was easy to imagine that these characters had been plucked off a New York street circa 1918.Rick Schroeder gives a first rate performance as the deeply conflicted Major Whittlesey , torn between doing his duty and the welfare of his men.There are a few moments where the film hits a false note . Whittlesey 's car at the beginning probably was n't built for 15 years after the Great War ended . The scene where the major receives his orders seems to ignore military protocol . And in a major continuity glitch , Whittlesey 's executive office talks about the errant artillery barrage was it had happened that day , when it had happened the day before.This are just minor potholes in an otherwise first rate effort .
