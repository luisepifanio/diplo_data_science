Ripe is not an exploitative Lolita sex film as the oversaturated key art may suggest . Instead , it is a challenging , offbeat exploration of female sexuality and coming of age , imaginatively directed and well acted by its three leads.The script sometimes gets rocky and crude as with many indie films ( too much swearing is a curse in indie scripts ) , but the film is visually stunning , and the cumulation of small moments is delicious -- when Violet discovers the adult magazines , for example , or when the gruff man who takes the sisters in has to explain menstruation to her . And the final scene with the two sisters is devastating , a weird amalgam of suspense , family drama , and psychosexual overtones.A wonderful music score by Anton Sanko ( ex-Suzanne Vega Band ) augments this aesthetically excellent , curiously poignant , ultimately very dark film .
