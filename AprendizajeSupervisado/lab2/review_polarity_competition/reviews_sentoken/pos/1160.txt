4.6 starsI love this flick , and think both the script and Ford do justice to the original , justifiably beloved tv series . I do n't think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print , though ; while it 's a good , crisp picture , it 's not much of an improvement over my dvd.The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series , and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent updating that works well . There 's thrills aplenty , with minimal violence , which I appreciate more every year as idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-planned plots . There 's more intelligence than that at work here , and director Andrew Davis makes it all mesh tightly and suspensefully . The ending is a bit weak : I do n't buy the scene at the conference , but it works to the degree it must , and that 's good enough.Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it 's a movie worth watching many times , whenever one needs to be reminded what a truly fine thriller can be.Too bad they did n't polish it up enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high-def .
