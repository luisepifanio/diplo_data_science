This movie is a superb blend of Hitchcock 's storytelling technique and his macabre sense of humor . The story is excellently crafted . The audience sympathizes right away w/ Hannay as he listens to the spy 's incredible story . And it fears for his safety at the words & quot ; Clear out , Hannay , you 're next ! & quot ; and the sight of the knife . Excellent romantic comedy bits as Hannay is handcuffed to a woman who dislikes him . And the lagniappe is the angle Mr. Memory is framed at at the end of the film . YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !
