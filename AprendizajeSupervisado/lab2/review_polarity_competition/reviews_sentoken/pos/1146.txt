Originally released as an 80 's `` 3-D film '' which is why theopening title is so hard to read on conventional TV withall the whizzy meteors flying out , Spacehunter is nonethelessa well made film that does `` take you out of your living room '' .For me , the vehicle designs and the rocky Utah scenary are thebest aspects of the film . The production design is brilliantand the acting convincing . The buggies are fantastic ! Well worth buying but perhaps more for diehard sci-fi fans . Thefilm is not really suitable for younger viewers even though itsmarketed at a `` Star Wars '' audience and has much of that film'scharacter and hardware style.Michael Ironside plays a great villian , a pity we do n't get alittle more of his charcater 's background and how he evolvedinto a villian .
