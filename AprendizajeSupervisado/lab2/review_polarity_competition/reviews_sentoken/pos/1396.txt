There are pleasant surprises in this film : Tori Spelling 's comedic ability , some nice original music , a pretty cast , and a premise fraught with comic possibilities -- two cute New York City guys trying to find someplace to have sex . But it would take much better writing and character development to make this into the zany farce it tries so hard to be . Nice try , though , and there are rewards . Gabriel ( Christian Campbell ) , an adorably nerdy aspiring song-writer with a quirky smile , picks up Mark ( John Paul Pitok ) , a darkly seductive and well-muscled Go-Go Dancer ( do they really still call them that ? ) , on the subway . This is his fantasy man ( justifiably so ) come to life . The two head back to Gabe 's apartment where they find his bubbly , self-centered best friend ( Spelling ) , an actress , printing out 150 resumes . That 's planning for a LOT of auditions , n'est-ce pas ? It 's the first in a looong string of frustrating attempts to be alone and , while there are some funny moments to be sure , the comedic results are questionable . The straight roommate shows up with his own trick and throws them out . In their continuing quest for privacy they encounter a Broadway Queen , a drag queen , and other characters , each more self-absorbed than the last . And they call the 70 's the & quot ; me & quot ; decade ! Absolutely no one notices that Mark and Gabe , holding hands and fidgeting and hinting , just might want to be alone . Gabe can not blow his horn and just say so . It 's like an extended sitcom episode . To top it off , after an entire night of getting to know Mark , with some lovely private moments along the way , Gabe insults him by acting like it 's still just a trick . Mark , in reel life , is much more forgiving and sweet than a gorgeous hunk is apt to be in real life , so it looks as if things will be alright . Worth watching just for the cute cast . Only deserved three stars , but that bumped it up to four .
