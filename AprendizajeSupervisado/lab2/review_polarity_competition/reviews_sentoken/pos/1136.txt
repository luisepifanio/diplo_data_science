For American Martial-Arts fans , this version is probably the only way to go . Mark Dacascos is awesome as renegade Toby Wong , a man with a & quot ; bio-engine & quot ; attached to his heart . His improved physical capabilities give a good excuse for many exciting martial arts sequences that are as close to Jackie Chan as you will get in a western movie . Kadeem Hardison ( & quot ; Dwayne Wayne & quot ; ) lends support as the comic sidekick , and does a good job . Brittany Murphy ( Clueless ) is pretty much wasted in her role as a wacky teen , but runs with her material as far as it will carry her ( and damn , is she hot while she does that ! ) . John-Pyper Ferguson should be happy he did n't sustain permanent damage to his jaw for chewing the scenery so much , but it fits in with the film.The real stars of this movie ( apart from Dacascos , who is an impressive martial artist ) are director Steve Wang , who has a firm grasp on the proceedings , and action director Koichi Sakamoto , who stages several hand-to-hand coflicts .
