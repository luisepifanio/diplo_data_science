Finally this movie is released on blu ray in its proper aspect ratio ! Tired of watching it in 1080i and in a 1.78 cropped aspect ratio , actually I should n't use the word crop because its Super 35 , so they just opened the bottom of the frame so you see more on the bottom ( always hated fake letterboxing ) . Anyway this blu ray , like the DVD shows the movie in 2.35 aspect ratio . The video is minor upgrade to DVD clarity wise , but not the Wow ! factor we come to expect from 1080p blu ray . The problem could be that Warner/New Line used a single layer disc ( 25 GB ) and not the superior 50 GB disc . Why would they , when the only thing on this disc is the movie and a theatrical trailer . I can not believe Warner released this the way they did . Do n't pay the outrageous price Amazon is asking . I got mine under 14 bucks at Best Buy . For this price its worth the upgrade . The soundtrack is still one of the better ones ! All in all , even with the minor video upgrade over DVD , its still a good buy at cheap price ... just wish it was better blu ray presentation . Stop being cheap Warner !
