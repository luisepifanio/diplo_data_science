First i have to say this . If you are expecting a story or hero like Spider-Man , you are in for a shock.The directors cut of Daredevil is one of the best directors cuts i have ever seen . Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes , but also ties up plot holes as well . There was also a whole subplot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock ( Ben Affleck ) and Foggy Nelson ( Jon Faverou ) defending what looks like a guilty client , played by the 90s rapper Coolio.In this cut , you see more Matt Murdock , and you can actually see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play the blind vigilantie . When i first saw the original version , i htought that Affleck was ok . But after this , i can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil/Matt Murdock.But still i have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show . Not only did he play him to a tea , but he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic series.The R rated director 's cut also has a more grittier , dark edge to the film , compared to the PG 13 rating that the original version has . Expect more graphic fight scenes , and plenty more swearing by the characters.Overall , I must say that this cut definitly does justice to fans of the comic . If you dont have this in your collection , get it.This DVD also has a good mini documentary about how the directors cut was made .
