My toddler is 27 months old . She adores `` all things Caillou . '' It even tops Elmo and Barney in her mind . This series is kind of like Leave it to Beaver for the toddler set . Very goofy to the adults but very appealing to the little ones . This video is pretty much just a tape from the series , but I still highly recommend it . My cutie asks for it every day and is mesmerized .
