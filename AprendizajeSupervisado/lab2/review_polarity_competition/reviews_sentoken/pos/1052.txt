Dreyfus , Clouseau 's old boss , has gone mad and wants to destroy the world with his X-ray machine in this movie . Our only hope is the incompetent chiefinspector , Jaques Clouseau , played by the comic genious Peter Sellers ( 1925-1980 , died of a heart attack ) . Are you looking for the best classical Clouseau-scenes ? This one includes the non-biting dog ( really ? ) , the inspector as a tooth-pulling dentist in disguise , and his attempt to get over a moat ! As in the other Pink Panther films , this too has n't got a really credible and reliable story , but that 's just a part of all the fun . Watch it over and over again , and notice all the funny details and mistakes Clouseau makes . This is the best Pink Panther movie , no doubt about it ! You MUST get this one in your collection !
