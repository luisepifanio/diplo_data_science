I am only writing this review so this movie does n't have the woefully misguided 3-stars from the single other reviewer.There are a handful of truly great Vietnam war films , and they generally each cover their own ground . Full Metal Jacket is kind of the exception in that it covers ground the other three all do separately.Platoon covers the actual combat , the feeling of hell that it produced in an individual experiencing the fighting , the jungle , the trauma in the moment that the trauma is happening.The Deer Hunter covers the post-war trauma , the long-scale effect on the psyche of a veteran.Apocalypse Now covers the psychological ( and poetic ) heart of war , that is , the core of what war means , which is hatred , fear , and the merciless nature of the universe . After all , it 's based on 'Heart of Darkness . ' It might , overall , be the most terrifying and compelling of them all . In turn , Heart of Darkness and this movie are based on a long line of literary background called the `` katabasis '' in Greek , that is , the descent into the underworld . It 's epic , punctuated by scene after scene which turns dark and twisted , and the protagonist is self-compelled , moving forward into hell without knowing why -- because as evil exists , he feels drawn to it , to try to understand it , or if he can not , to become a part of it . Transitively , it asks you to try to understand evil.If I did n't already own this , I would most definitely buy it instantly for 6 dollars , as anyone who sees this page and has not seen the film should do .
