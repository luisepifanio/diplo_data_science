Watching `` The Scent of Green Papaya ? is just like listening to a harmonious song . There is not much dialogue in this movie but you will not feel boring . I enjoy the tranquil , elegant , graceful mood of the movie . It uses many simple melodies and close-up shots in the film to reflect the frame of mind of the characters . The visual and hearing beauty brings you comfort when watching it . The first part of the film takes place in 1951 , it is when the French authority almost came to an end . French has occupied Vietnam for more than 30 years prior to 1954 . During the French administration , people in Vietnam had been influenced by the French . In the first half of the movie , Mui was living in a traditional family as a child servant . The grandmother lost her husband when she was still a teenager and she insisted on praying for her husband every morning and stay faithful to him . The father left home with another woman and took along all the money a few times but the mother would never blame him . Instead , the grandmother blamed her for not knowing how to please her own husband . In the second half of the film , Mui moved to a musician 's house also as a servant . The musician , who is also her master , named Khuyen , has been influenced by the French and knows how to play piano . His house was decorated all in French style , colorful and bright . Unlike the previous family , simple , antique , and all in wood . Khuyen was engaged but later then he found out that Mui was actually very attractive after she dressed up . He fell for her and afterwards he broke up with his fianc ? and married Mui . This film shows the difference between a traditional Vietnamese family and a modern westernize family . Not only the living environment have big difference but also the perception of relationships .
