This movie does have a couple of slow sections , or I would have given it 5 stars , and much of the humor in it is so random it makes you do sort of a double take . You have to watch it a couple of times to make sure of what you thought you saw . But overall , it 's one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! And the music is fantastic . Children of all ages will love the face-paced action , and older kids will understand a lot of the higher humor in it . It 's a must see and a must own !
