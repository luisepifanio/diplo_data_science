I got this movie on a whim , in part because I am tired of seeing Americans turning into either fat blobs or pussies afraid of their own shadow ( or worse , self-righteous morons who really think government is the answer to everything.Eastwood might hate the comparison , but this is a collage that goes well beyond The Karate Kid meets Secondhand Lions ( New Line Platinum Series ) .It most assuredly is right up there with Million Dollar Baby ( Full Screen Edition ) and Absolute Power.It 's hard to sum up this movie so I will say just three things:1 . He weaves every possible American hard-ass self-made man image in as gracefully as it could be done.2 . He does for the hill people of Viet-Nam what Bride and Prejudice did for India but without the music , love , and dance.3 . The ending is spectacular -- Eastwood 's voice in the background , slow singing against a visual as the Gran Torino drives toward the future with its special passenger who inherited from the master . For this alone I would rent or buy the DVD .
