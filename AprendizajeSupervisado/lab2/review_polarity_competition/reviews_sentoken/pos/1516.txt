An astonishing film made under almost impossible circumstances . Set in Paris in the 1840s along a lower-class theatre district ( the `` Boulevard of Crime '' ) , the main story is about a mime ( played by Jean-Louis Barrault ) who falls in love with `` a woman of experience '' - played brilliantly by Arletty . In an incredibly poignant and delicate scene , Arletty just about begs Barrault to make love to her , but he does n't seize the moment and he leaves her . She finds lust in the arms of others.Other major characters include a degenerate philosopher/writer ; a Shakespearean actor ; a rich count who `` keeps '' Arletty ; and the woman who loves Barrault and eventually marries him . But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true down through the years , though at the end , after spending one glorious night together , she leaves him for good . The acting is superb throughout , though what makes the movie a masterpiece is the writing of Jacques Prevert : the dialogue is simply brilliant . The movie was filmed during the Nazi occupation and many of the actors would leave the set to go off and fight in the resistance . Sets were constantly moved to avoid bombing raids and Nazi interference , when possible . The film is c.190 minutes long ; the Nazis had a law that no film could exceed 90 minutes , so this was made as TWO independent films . The movie is not only a testament to love in all its passionate intensity ( it is a French movie , after all ) , it is also about the survival of a country and great city , Paris - an entire civilization , actually - suffering under the bootheel of a fierce oppressor : it is about the light of love and culture and memory shining ever brightly out of the darkness of hell . An astounding achievement in all phases of the moviemaking process , from the story 's message to the sets to the acting to the photography : it 's a movie for all time .
