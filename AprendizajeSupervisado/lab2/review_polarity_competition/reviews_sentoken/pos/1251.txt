I had previously been using Jillian 's `` 30 Day Shred '' DVD and wanted to change my routine . A friend told me about `` No More Trouble Zones '' and I decided to give it a try . NMTZ is definitely harder than 30 Day Shred ! I like the variety of moves and that this workout calls for more repetitions with lighter weights . It 's also nice that you can choose to play the entire workout or select different segments from the menu . Each segment is about 5-7 minutes long and focuses on certain areas such as abs/chest or core . The biggest drawback for me is that I 've been using this DVD 2-3 times a week for about a month , and I have n't seen a noticeable difference in my `` trouble zones '' . I am already in pretty good shape - I also run 3-4 times a week and am careful about what I eat - but I was hoping this workout would help me firm up a little bit more . I am going to keep at it , though ! I would also caution that if you prefer a lower-impact , sweat-free workout , this DVD is not for you . When Jillian says `` you should feel like you 're going to die '' , she means it ...
