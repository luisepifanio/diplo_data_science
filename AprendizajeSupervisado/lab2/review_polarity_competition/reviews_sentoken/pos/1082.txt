This movie is a lot of fun , and much smarter than some people will give it credit for . Great comedic performances by Alan Cumming and Parker Posey , who between them chew enough scenery to create a soundstage . And the Pussycats are genuinely fun , hot babes : it 's not Rachel Leigh Cook who steals the show as Josie , but Tara Reid , whose giggly blondeness recalls a `` Laugh-In '' era Goldie Hawn . Lots of great in-jokes ( get the PG-13 version ) , totally `` jerkin ' '' costumes , a few catchy songs ... and yes , all those product placements . ( Hint : spotting them makes a great , if fast-moving , drinking game ! ) If it 's not the `` Heathers '' of the 00 's , it 's almost the `` Girls Just Wan na Have Fun '' .
