Most movies are about The Christ or Paul or Joseph or Moses . This movie is not only about Jesus , The Christ , but it recounts the personalities of the apostles themselves . It makes the watcher understand that they have the same strengths and weaknesses as the apostles . Doubting Thomas . Peter and his temper . Matthew . James and John , the sons of Zebedee . It is equally about each apostle as much as about the Christ.The rendition of the Last Supper and what each apostle must have thought when Christ announced that one of them would betray them is extremely moving.It made all of these people very real and human to me .
