I started my son with Baby Einstein DVDs since he was 3 months old and he absolutely loves them ! ! ( He 's 8 months old now ) He especially loves Baby Mozart , not only because he loves to hear the music ( he 's a real Mozart fan ever since he was in my tummy ) , but he gets a kick out of the toys and other visual stimulation the DVD has . Compared to Baby Beethovan , Baby Mozart continously keeps his attention . There are some parts of Baby Beethovan DVD that have pictures of animals and my son did n't like that . He 'd rather see the animals move than see a picture of them . Hey , that 's what books are for , right ? He also loves Baby Eistein Language for the same reasons . Very colorful and keeps his attention .
