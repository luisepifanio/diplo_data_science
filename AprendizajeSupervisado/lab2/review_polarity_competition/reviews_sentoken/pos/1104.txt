This is a good old fashioned adventure , with some comedy and good natured suspense . We remember it from when it was released , but my 8 year old grandaughter loved it - she watched it twice ! We are a little disappointed in the quality of the DVD ; it does seem quite grainy and not much better picture that the VHS .
