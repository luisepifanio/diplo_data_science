`` Destination Moon '' and `` Rocketship XM '' both came out the same year -- but that is where the similarity ends . I consider `` Destination Moon '' the father of the modern science-fiction film . The quality of the production and the gorgeous Technicolor give this film a quality few later '50 's sci-fi films would achieve . What helps this flm is the fact that there are no real stars in it -- but very competent and very recognizable actors at the least . `` Rocketship XM '' on the other hand was a hurry-up film made to beat `` ... Moon '' to the theaters . The B/W print quality is gorgeous , having been restored to its original sharp quality . Lloyd Bridges stars . The special effects for `` XM '' were decent for their time , but the effects for `` ... Moon '' were ahead of their time . If I were grading these films , I would give `` ..Moon '' a B+ , and `` XM '' a C+ . Both films are enjoyable , and make nice companion pieces .
