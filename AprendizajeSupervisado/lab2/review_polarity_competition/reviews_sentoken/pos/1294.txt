i had to buy it after seeing it , i knew it would be a great movie since i had previously seen LOVERS & MAD LOVE both by Vicente Aranda , all beautifully presented with very well acted scenes and excellent taste music spots and of course Aranda 's always honest and interesting style that shows historical movies without hypocrisy , that 's why i also bought THE BORGIAS and would buy all of Aranda 's movies .
