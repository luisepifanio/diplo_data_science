I usually hate anime . I 'm the type of person that complains every time I see a book made into a movie , just because I do n't think adaptations do justice to the original work . I 'm a big fan of the manga , so I thought I 'd give the anime a shot . I was extremely shocked when I began watching . This show is just as good as the manga . It follows the story line , with the addition/subtraction of some plot points and a different Ouran Fair plot . Each of the voice actors ( in English and Japanese ) do each character justice . The characters themselves are hilarious and diverse . The plot is entertaining . Do n't let the pink covering fool you ; this show is n't even that girly/shojo-y . The fact that I actually bought the series really says something , especially since I watched the whole series twice through a friend before buying it on Amazon ( and I 'm super duper frugal ) . Since buying it , I 've watched all the episodes at least two more times , my favorites more . This really is a must have . If I could , I would give this series a higher rating .
