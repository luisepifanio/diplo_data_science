G.D really is nearly perfect . I never tire of it . At the same time I think most people miss the point . ( By the way , I 've NOT seen the Special Edition . ) I 'm facinated each time watching the totally self centered Bill Murray caught in this marvelous time paradox , living the same day over and over . He goes through differing stages : fear and confusion ; euphoria , when he realizes he can do ANYTHING without consequence ; despair , when he realizes that life is meaningless if one pursues selfish pleasures without goals ; and finally a peaceful self actualization when he dedicates himself toward self improvement and the humanitarian goals his situation gives him the opportunity to pursue.It gives one pause to consider what each of US would do in a similar circumstance.Oh , it 's really funny , too .
