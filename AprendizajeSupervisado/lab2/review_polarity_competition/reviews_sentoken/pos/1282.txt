we 've all seen the movie and we all know colorization sucks , so the important thing here is Mike Nelson 's commentary . i see a lot of people do n't `` get it '' , but if you 're into Nelson 's acerbic wit then you should enjoy this DVD . it does nothing to further your love foe NOTLD but it 's plain funny . so piss on all these bad reviews , if your an MST:3K fan , please realize , these people take themselves WAY too seriously .
