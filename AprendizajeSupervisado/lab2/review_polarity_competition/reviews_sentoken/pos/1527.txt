warner made another beautiful HD transfer . I ca n't find another wrong , no grain anywhere . Just a perfect crystal clear image from start to finish . The cinematography will blow you away . Would give this 6 stars if i could . So far I find warner is the only studio willing to give HD addicts the best video quality possible . Some studios just throw a title on blu-ray and expect us to say , thank you for releasing it .
