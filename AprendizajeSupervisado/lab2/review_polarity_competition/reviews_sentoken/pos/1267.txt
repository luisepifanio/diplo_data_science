This is just one of the questions asked and answered in this little gem of a movie . ( btw , the answer is & quot ; Maybe because they fear death. & quot ; Both sweet and tart , it has just the right blend of humor , melancholy , and true love . Cher is at her best here as Loretta Castorini , a widow who falls in love with the younger brother of her fiance , Nicholas Case and Danny Aiello respectively -- both equally amazing in these roles . Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia round out the case as Loretta 's parents . Feodor Chaliapin Jr. is priceless as Loretta 's dog-doting grandfather and catch John Mahoney before he became & quot ; Frasier & quot ; 's dad.My favorite scene is the where Loretta first meets Johnny at the bakery . Nicholas Cage gives the funniest , saddest speech about his past . I know the whole scene by heart .
