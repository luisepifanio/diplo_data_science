Ever say , & quot ; Everyone here 's crazy but me & quot ; ? Then you 'll love this frightening , minimalist , low budget and very claustrophobic 1948 thriller . Detective Richard Carlson checks himself into an asylum in an attempt to find a crooked judge hiding from justice . But before he can nail the judge , his identity is uncovered and he becomes a prisoner of his own scheme . And the only person who can rescue him is the double crossing woman who sent him there ! A hard-edged , bare-bones thriller from director Budd Boetticher ( & quot ; The Killer is Loose , & quot ; & quot ; Comanche Station , & quot ; & quot ; Bullfighter And The Lady & quot ; ) who would later gain fame from a series of stark , existential westerns ( & quot ; The Tall T , & quot ; & quot ; Ride Lonesome , & quot ; & quot ; Seven Men From Now & quot ; etc . ) starring damaged , moral loner Randolph Scott adrift in an ambiguous amoral environment . Personal note : In the 70 's I got to know the late Budd Boetticher as a friend . We 'd go riding in Griffith Park on his Andalusians and we made several trips to Mexico where he still practiced his dangerous and beloved craft of fighting bulls from horseback . In life and in films , he seemed obsessed with playing out the role of male antagonist in constant battle with his surroundings . Boetticher preceded director Sam Peckinpah in themes that made the latter famous . Boetticher was the real thing . It 's great to see this early gem available on DVD . ( Full Screen , B & amp ; W , 68 minutes , Not Rated . )
