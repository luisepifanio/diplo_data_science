Wonderful film rendition of the Jane Austen masterpiece . In an age when sicial graces and class distinctions ruled , the Dashwood sisters fall in love . Kate Winslet is enchanting as Marianne Dashwood , Emma Thompson makes for an excellent Elinor Daswood , and Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman are wonderful here as Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon , roles for which they seem to have been made . And who of , course , could forget the costumes ? Its a shame that Sense and Sensibility did n't win more awards when it first came out . Never mind ; true fans of this genre will appreciate what a classic this movie really is .
