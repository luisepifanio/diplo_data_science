It seems that good movies inspire remakes . As to whether they are & quot ; inspired & quot ; remakes is always open to question . Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting but for sheer acting chops and fun ( with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake who seems like he 's trapped in a film he does n't like ) , 1969 's The Italian Job is my personal pick of the two . Mark Wahlberg ca n't hold a candle ( and is n't much of an actor frankly ) to Michael Caine in the original film . There 's almost as many things that make this classic film tick as there are seconds on a clock . The plot focuses more on the getaway than the caper . This unique twist turned the formular on its head . The terrific cast ( including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearence and , of all people , Benny Hill ! ) features the marvelous Michael Caine in the lead . He gives a great performance and helps the ensemble rise to the occasion.The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and wit bringing to life what could have been , despite its plot twists , a routine film . Collinson is something of a cult director who died relatively young before he could fulfill his full promise as a director . I 'd also recommend his cult classic psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning which became available last year on DVD . While it 's hampered by some mid-70 's editing and visual conventions , Morning more than holds its own with the explotiation films of the time.Complimenting the film is a commentary track which features the film 's original producer as well as a number of nice extras . It 's great to also have this minor classic finally restored to its proper aspect ratio . The DVD transfer is pretty good and while the quality of the print varies a bit , it 's really good on the whole .
