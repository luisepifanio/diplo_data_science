Websites that track positive and negative reviews from the major critics register a positive score of at least 95 % for Ratatouille , clearly putting it at the top of the films of 2007 . Is it the best film of the year ? No , but it 's the one with the greatest appeal , as nearly everyone will consider viewing it to be a positive experience.Ratatouille follows Remy , a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief . Remy 's acute sense of smell and appreciation for food attract him to the culinary arts . By stealing what he can from a elderly homeowners appreciation for cooking shows and books , Remy becomes a devotee of one of France 's most famous chefs , Auguste Gusteau ' . After Remy learns that Gusteau died years and he had been watching reruns of his television program , the little rat begins to be guided Ben Kenobi-like by the spirit of the dead chef.Following the spirit eventually leads him to Gusteau 's former restaurant , which has been taken over by a artless capitalist who uses Gusteau 's image to sell frozen burritos and corndogs . By using a young kitchen worker as a medium , Remy tries to rebuild the reputation of Gusteau and return his restaurant to its glory.The resulting action is an often charming tale of a rat as much devoted to finding himself as achieving his goal . Lots of laughs are found when his family shows up looking for handouts , and the chief antagonists ( the owner and a food critic ) create real dramatic moments of peril . Remy is truly a film `` hero '' , someone devoted to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place . Although lacking the heart of the Toy Story films or the comic brilliance of the first Shrek , Ratatouille continues the trend of the animation renaissance that has provided some of the best films of the last decade .
