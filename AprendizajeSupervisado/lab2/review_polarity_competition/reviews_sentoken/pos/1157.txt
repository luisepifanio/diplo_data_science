This review is about the blu-ray only , since there are plenty of reviews here on the movie itself and there are only so many ways to say the movie is genius . I was slightly skeptical about this blu-ray because I had read that it was n't much of an upgrade over the Jane Doe edition . Technically , that might be true , but the truth is that this is the best Fletch has ever looked and might be as good as it ever gets . I do n't know if they can invent a format that can breathe too much life into a mid-1980 's comedy that was not originally intended/budgeted to be a visual spectacle . Yeah this movie does n't look like The Departed on blu-ray , but it 's an improvement over the DVD and that 's really all you can ask for . For $ 10 , it 's hard to beat and to me it 's a no-brainer if you are a fan of the movie .
