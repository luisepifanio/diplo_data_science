Hmmmmm ... you kinda get the impression that the makers of this film had some legal problems so they had to drop any reference to the jam band PHISH from the film - - so even though they 're following a Phish-like band , with very Phish-like followers listening to very Phish-like music and smoking and dropping Phish-like stuff on a Phish-like scene you do n't really hear the word PHISH that much ... Whatever the case , I kinda dug the film at first for the music - - lot 's of that funky jam stuff ... even some Dead , Meters , Bob Marley ... then there was the story ... and of course you have the emotional tie in ... at first this nieve kid liberated from a snobby boarding school making the scene , making friends , experiencing the music and drugs , then getting too deep and turning into this messed up acid head drug dealer at odds with his girlfriend and his Dad and step Mom - - eventually , the story goes from Rock and Roll to ABC after school special but overall its a pretty cool film ... and besides , I do n't even drop acid , and I 've seen colors coming out of water fountain like that too ! Thirty some years after THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT , HAIR and BILLY JACK , this is a film for and by the groovy people !
