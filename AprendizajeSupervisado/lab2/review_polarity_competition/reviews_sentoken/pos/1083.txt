Stephen King is best known for his books of the macabre , but what some people do n't know , is that he 's also a master of comedy - as is the case with `` The Langoliers '' .The book was a very complex and hilarious study of the human mind . The movie delves even deeper , showing just how funny people can be when faced with eminent destruction.Both the movie and the book ask the question , `` What would you do if you fell asleep on an airplane , but everybody that was awake , died , and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath , and another is a blind girl who can sense evil , kind of like Haley Joel Osment in `` The Sixth Sense '' , then you seek shelter in an airport , but all the carbonated drinks are flat and the food is spoiled , then you find out that these Pac-Man-like creatures ( `` the Langoliers '' ) literally consume the past ? `` Well , what would you do ? It 's a tricky question , and to be honest with you , I do n't know what I would do . But I can tell one thing , Bronson Pinchot ( in a performance that 's quite a departure from his beloved Balki Bartokomous character on the popular TV show , `` Perfect Strangers '' ) does n't know how to answer the question either . Man , does he go crazy - and I 'm not talking Riggs in `` Lethal Weapon '' crazy - I mean he goes REALLY crazy . You can tell that Pinchot really embraced this role for what it was and took method acting to an entirely new level.Still not convinced ? After all the laughs and slapstick routines ( the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks the beer in the airport is absolutely brilliant ! ) , you are treated to a fantastic , suspenseful chase scene where the Langoliers chase the speeding plane down the runaway . Just as the plane is getting ready to takeoff the Langoliers razor-sharp teeth ... Sorry , but you 're going to have to watch the movie to find out how it ends.That is , if the Langoliers do n't get to you first .
