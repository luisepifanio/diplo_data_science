Although the story surrounds the Spanish Jesuits building a mission in the South American wilderness , the real action takes place in the heart.Robert DeNiro gives his best performance ever as an utterly depraved , tormenting slave trader that becomes truly repentant . This is a beautiful story of grace , as DeNiro tries to pay the ransom of his guilt , and begins to discover mercy , and God 's unconditional love.At the same time , questions are raised surrounding the motives behind missionary work . They should be inspired by the love of God , but other aspirations have been the impetus for many throughout history . Just as in the Crusades , there were some very good intentioned Christians , but there were also many that killed and conquered in the name of a loving God.This exemplary historical film will provoke thoughts and leave viewers enriched !
