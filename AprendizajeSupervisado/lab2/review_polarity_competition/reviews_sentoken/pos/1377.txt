The story line is run-of-the-mill , OK I guess considering it 's for kids . The animation steals the show , the dinosaurs seem real , and the landscapes are gorgeous , you 're just carried back into another world . My 4 year old nephew loves this movie , even with some parts that I thought might be too scary , like the carnotaurs , and the terrifically done meteor impact .
