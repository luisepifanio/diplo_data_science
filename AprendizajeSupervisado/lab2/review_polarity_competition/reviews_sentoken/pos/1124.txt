`` You stepped out of a dream '' is one of the great songs from this outstanding motion picture . This number alone will give you chills and even if your a guy you would wonder what it would be like to decend on a glamor staircase . It the production number you do n't want to have end . It is just beautiful . The whole entire film is also outstanding but the last scene before the final number in true Lana Turner fasion steals the film . In this scene she is fatally ill and leaves the theare while Tony Martin is singing `` You stepped out of a dream . '' In her trade mark jestures at the top of the stair case without any dialog only music she thinks of being that beautiful Ziegfield girl again and decends down the stairs . The music builds and then she collapses . Oh , , , what a dramatic scene . This entire film will make your heart pound and only wish that Hollywood could produce something like this again .
