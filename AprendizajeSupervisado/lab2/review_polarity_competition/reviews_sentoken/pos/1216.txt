This film was generally overlooked upon release . Predating Lone Star and Thunderheart , this film has three amazing things going for it : ( 1 ) the cast is stellar . You get Dafoe , in a good guy role , M Emmett Walsh as a lazy coroner , Mary Elizabeth Mastronantino in an amazing lead role , Sam Jackson ( how he 's listed on the end credits ) tearing up the scenery , Mickey Roarke in a GOOD performance , and even an uncredited thankless role . ( 2 ) the plot is much better than No Way Out . With Donaldson directing , you might think that it would just be a remake/remuddle , but the plot does keep twisting , and once you think you have it even remotely figured out , BANG something else happens . ( 3 ) the scenery is amazing . The only film that comes closer to capturing the feel of the New Mexican landscape is Backtrack , which is also very good . The widescreen adds ( although it is fair to ask when it DOES N'T ) , so , if you were like me and did n't see this until it came out on VHS , you 're in for a treat . Not all of it does work -- you do keep waiting for Dafoe to become the creep he is in most of his films since Wild at Heart , or Roarke to make little sense , but like Angelheart , he is focused and amazing here , but it does n't happen . Not a whole lot of extras here , unfortunately ( maybe there 's a director 's edition somewhere with more of Mimi Rogers in it , but as it stands , this is a terrific movie . Four stars out of five .
