Having seen the series when it was aired originally in the '70 's , I have waited 30 years to buy it on tape . For those of you who want the best of the Masterpiece Theatre approach , with Susan Hampshire and an outstanding cast , the most gorgeous music you have ever heard , a story that will keep you glued to the screen , you will NOT be disappointed . The two best series ever put out by the BBC are The Foryste Saga and The Pallisers . Enjoy !
