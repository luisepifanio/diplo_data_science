Of all of Fritz Lang 's American films , SCARLET STREET is my favorite . And now , finally , it 's available in a version I can actually SEE . This is , without question , the best quality edition available . ( All other distributors offer variations of the same grainy , fuzzy , dupey-looking public-domain print that 's been circulating for years . ) SCARLET STREET is a remake of Jean Renoir 's LA CHIENNE ( THE BITCH ) , and it would have been great if Kino could have released both titles as a Double Feature . Nevertheless , I 'm thrilled to finally own an excellent quality copy of it ; the disc also features a terrific audio commentary by historian David Kalat .
