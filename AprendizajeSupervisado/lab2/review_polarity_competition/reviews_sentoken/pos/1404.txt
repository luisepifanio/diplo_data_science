One of the most delightful films of recent years , `` Calendar Girls , '' a distaff version of `` The Full Monty , '' is the true story of a group of middle-aged English women who became international celebrities when they designed and posed for a nude fundraising calendar that sold millions of copies worldwide . Julie Walters and Helen Mirren head a wonderful cast , with Walters as a woman whose husband dies of leukemia and Mirren as her best friend who comes up with the idea of the calendar as a way of both honoring his memory and raising money for the local hospital . The risk for any `` feel good '' comedy is that it will become cloying , coy or cutesy . Luckily , `` Calendar Girls '' boasts an enormously witty screenplay and first-rate performances by its highly gifted cast . Each of the `` girls '' is given her own unique personality so that we see them not just as a group , united in this inspiring endeavor , but as individuals working through their own personal demons on the rode to the project 's completion . The women face the expected roadblocks and snafus in the form of `` shocked , '' disapproving voices in the community , but their belief in the rightness of their cause brushes all such problems aside . This charming film provides more genuine , out-and-out laughs than almost any comedy of recent times . `` Calendar Girls '' is heartwarming , touching and inspiring - and what more could one ask from a `` feel-good '' film than that ?
