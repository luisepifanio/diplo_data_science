This is a movie that is more about redemption than about sheer race issues . Kowalski lives in a run down part of Detroit , where he is a retired auto worker and Korean War Veteran . He is a surly old man who despises everything and seemingly everyone . His nieghborhood is totally Hmong with the only exception being him.We view him with his family , and interacting with his neighbors and then as you have seen in the trailers , his dealings with the local youths . He starts a relationship with Thao and Sue , young Hmong neighbors who he builds an affinity for . Totally politically incorrect , Kowalski spews racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence . He is a bit of a loaner , especially since he became a widower , but he enjoys his car and his home and wishes his world had not changed so much.Kowalski calls everyone names , to their faces and he really does not care what type of rise it gets out of people . He basically offends evryone , whites , blacks , hispanics , asians . But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethic perspectives and their own racism.Thao and Sue are like those you hear of in the news , the kids who have trouble come upon them , simply because they live in these areas . Kowalski gets to know the Hmong , and they him . He defends his home , his property and his friends.Realism although surreal , has our senses impacted when you see the results of fighting . At times , it leads to more of the same . Kowalski , though is a figure of redemption , he impacts everyone who knows him eventually , yet the most impact is on the viewer of Gran Torino.The extras in the DVD are good , more about cars than about society . Wish there was more on the inner city and gang problems in this to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars .
