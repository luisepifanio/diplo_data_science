Arguably , this is the funniest of the Vacation movies . The true test of a good comedy is being able to still howl over the film years later , and `` Christmas Vacation '' more than does that for me . But this one works in reverse : Instead of the disaster-prone Griswolds travelling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World , they 're anchored to the homefront as the calendar ticks off the days to Christmas . Chevy Chase is clearly in his element here reprising his role as well-intended but hopelessly klutzy matriarch Clark , who naturally , goes overboard with creating `` the perfect Christmas '' . The reliably good Beverly D'Angelo is here too as Clark 's supportive wife who gets her buttons pushed by annoying relatives & whining children as well as her doltish husband.The late John Hughes crams the script full of holiday satire & references , punched up with the trademark `` Lampoon '' slapstick & lowbrow humor . Granted , sometimes the humor tanks , but it 's a nobler effort than the previous uneven `` European Vacation '' . This one just defies you not to laugh your head off as the Griswolds ' efforts to have `` the best Christmas '' turns into one long train wreck , which can tickle the funny bone of any `` Scrooge '' .Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis & Johnny Galecki ( the latter currently on the hit sitcom `` The Big Bang Theory '' ) as the Griswold kids ; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as one-half of snobby yuppie neighbors suffering at the hands of Clark ; and Doris Roberts , Diane Ladd & William Hickey as some of the troublesome relatives come to visit . But it 's actually Randy Quaid 's reprisal of goofy , freeloading hick cousin Eddie that steals every scene he 's in.If you want a serious rendition of a Holiday classic , watch `` It 's a Wonderful Life '' ; if you want to laugh hard & often , then definitely watch this one !
