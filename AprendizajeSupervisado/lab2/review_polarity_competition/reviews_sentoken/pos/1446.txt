Because this movie is out of print , it took me a few weeks to locate a copy . However , once I did , it felt like I had found the horror movie holy grail.The story revolves around a scandalous affair had by a bored housewife ( Julia Cotton ) and her brother in law ( Frank Cotton ) . Julia and her husband move into Frank 's old house after Frank 's sudden disapearance.Of course , Frank has n't really disapeared . Instead , the pervert brother in law has found a puzzle shaped like a cube . The puzzle , when opened , unlocks a portal to the world of the Cenobites . The Cenobites offer the ultimate pleasure , but at a high cost.Able to escape the world of the Cenobites once a drop of his brother 's blood has been spilled on the floor of the house , Frank returns as a walking corpse , needing body parts from living beings to complete himself again . Frank uses his past relationship with Julia to convince her to bring him fresh victims . With every victim , Frank becomes more complete , but also more impatient . There are several foreshadowing , praying mantis/evil spider lady scenes with Julia as she goes out to bars and picks up random men for the slaughter . Of course , eventually her actions bring out suspicions in her grown up stepdaughter and her husband ... The movie features the introduction of the Cenobites , who are some of the spookiest cats in horror since the Xenomorphs from Alien . As the movie progresses , we learn more about these beings , their origin , and purpose.Of course , the ending leaves everything open ended , which leads to the several sequels . I highly recommend this movie to those who like to watch early horror movies made by those now considered to be masters of the genre .
