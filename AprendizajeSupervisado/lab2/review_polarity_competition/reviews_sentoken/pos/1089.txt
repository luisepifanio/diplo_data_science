It is nearly impossible not to fall for this sunshiny movie , with its adorable leads and delightfully romantic and sexy premise : where and when can we finally DO IT ? I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Tori Spelling , who , with surprising comedic skills , nearly steals the movie away from its mostly male cast . This breezy and somehow old-fashioned gay romance is hard to resist .
