Jerry Lewis is Jerome Littlefield , an orderly at a mental institution who acts crazier than the patients . Since Frank Tashlin directed this movie , Jerry is free to concentrate solely on his performance , which he does to perfection . Once again Jerry is the lovable loser , who was thrown out of medical school because he felt the symptoms of every patient he diagnosed . This movie features a lot of great sight gags . Jerry fixes a television set in a patient 's room that has poor reception , also known as snow . When he takes out the front of the TV , snow comes flying out of the set and soon fills the room ! A patient is in a full body cast from head to toe , looking like a plastered mummy . Jerry accidentally knocks him over , the patient goes rolling down a hill and crashes into a tree . There 's pieces of broken plaster everywhere , but no body ! Jerry declares , & quot ; I lost a patient ! & quot ; The movie concludes with one of the craziest chase scenes in movie history , as a wheeled stretcher with an injured man on it rolls out of the back of an ambulance and continues to roll down hills , while first one , then two ambulances chase him . This movie features more LPMs ( laughs per minute ) than most modern comedies , and is one of Jerry 's funniest films .
