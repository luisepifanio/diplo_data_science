Alice Walker is a great pioneer . She is one of those Afro-American women who deserves all our love and adoration . She explores in this film , and behind it in the book , the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their ancillary slavery . It must all start in their heads . They must find the courage to develop their own personalities and freedom in the closed jail of their skulls , and then , little by little they find the strength and the power to resist men , and then society , and then to excell . Liberatiion is a mental process that finds its total power when it gets public and looks at society as the natural field of its realization . The film is touching , poignant , sensitive , intelligent , sentimental and tremendously potent , if not even pregnant with the most universal language we can imagine , the language of the liberation of women seen as the first step of the liberation of humanity . Alice Walker is universal in this story and she deals with the whole world , and with every single human being . What 's more , no one is lost , no one is abandoned on the side of the road , no one is forever wasted to the cause of liberation . Even the worst tyrant will find in his or her moral depth the idea and the initiative that will make him or her free along with the others , along with those he or she has ensalved for decades . The husband pays for the immigration of his wife 's sister 's own African husband and family . And he does it for nothing at all , because he stays on the side and does not claim his due . Salvation is for everyone or it will not be . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , Paris Universities II and IX .
