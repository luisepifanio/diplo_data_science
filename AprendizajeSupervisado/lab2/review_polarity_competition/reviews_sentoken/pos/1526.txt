This is the best movie I 've seen in a long time . I went 3 times to the theater to see it , and I 'm almost 30 ! : ) If you are a beatles fan , you will fall in love with this movie ! ! My dad is a huge fan of the beatles , and was n't sure if he would like the covers or the movie in general . We went , and he cried , and laughed , and LOVED the movie as much as I did . There are a lot of insider beatles fan stuff in the movie as well . Things that you will get being a fan . I can not wait for this movie to release on dvd . I hope it has a lot of special features . Only problem is , I wish it would release for the holiday season . Thanks for reading , and please go see the movie , and buy the DVD ! !
