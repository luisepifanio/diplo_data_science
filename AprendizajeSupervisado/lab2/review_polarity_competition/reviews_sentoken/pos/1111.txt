Put me to use . That 's what the so-called Ritchie Boys asked of the U.S. Army in World War II , and they got what they wanted . These new recruits , alien refugees -- some fresh off the boat from Europe -- were shipped off to Camp Ritchie to learn how the German military did its thing so they could interrogate prisoners in warzones . It 's a World War II story that had n't been told yet , and the Ritchie Boys themselves make for engaging watching and a wonderful story . These are soldiers most of us can relate to , people who were n't so good at handling firearms but became single-minded in their work to charm , confuse , and terrify POWs who showed up and had information they wanted.This is an excellent addition to the growing sub-genres of Jewish and World War II documentaries , and sports skillful use of talking-head inteviews , music , and archival footage.DVD Extras : A full 43 minutes of deleted scenes and personal accounts fill out the disc .
