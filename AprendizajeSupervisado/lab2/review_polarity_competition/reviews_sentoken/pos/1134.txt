Tom Hanks is the grown-up man with the 13-year-old mind . As aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big , and his wish is granted ( physically but not mentally ) . He goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish ; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company . Basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a `` child '' in the adult world , but it tends toward other issues , too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood . Hanks , of course , is a hit at the toy company ( what 13 year old would n't be ? ) . But he falls in love with a co-worker , which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending . Hanks is very good in this child 's role . Worth a watch .
