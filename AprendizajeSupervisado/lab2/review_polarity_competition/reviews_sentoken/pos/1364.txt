While for me `` Upstairs , Downstairs '' remains the finest Masterpiece Theatre series of all time , this one runs it a close second . Gemma Jones is superb as Louisa Trotter , the Cockney Cook/Hotelienne who never loses her blunt common-sense ways or her heavy cockney accent even after she becomes Hostess to Edwardian England 's Rich and Famous . The earlier episodes focus on Louisa 's rise from assistant cook to mistress of the Prince of Wales ( later King Edward VII ) . But most of the series concerns the doings at the Bentinck Hotel , an exclusive , private establishment in London owned and run by Louisa . With few exceptions , one 's family has to have been listed in Debrett 's Peerage for at least 100 years before one can book a room at the Bentinck . And yet , Louisa 's selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery on her part as it is of her passionate commitment to being The Best at whatever she does.Thee entire series is rich in characters and incident , and in fact Jones/Louisa is very much in the background in several of the episodes . But she is unquestionably the dominant , and dominating , character in this series . You have n't seen Unbridled Righteous Indignation until you 've seen Louisa , in the last episode in this collection , testifying at trial on behalf of her friend , Lord Haslemere , pouring forth diatribe after diatribe in all her cockney glory . Now THAT 'S a Character ! This wonderful series deserves to be much better known than it is . Do not hesitate to acquire this set . I ca n't wait for Series 2 !
