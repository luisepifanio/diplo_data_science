This was a very good action film . This movie had everything that an audience could ever hope for . You had an excellent hero in the person of Keanu Reeves . You had a very evil villain with actor Dennis Hopper . Your heroine was well played by Sandra Bullock . This movie featured outstanding special effects that made the handiwork of mad bomber Dennis Hopper even more realistic as well as being scary . Fron the opening scene on the elevator , the bus ride as well as the subway shot were very capable of keeping you on the edge of your seat . You could describe this movie as being a trend setter . Be sure to buy and watch this movie . You will not be dissapointed .
