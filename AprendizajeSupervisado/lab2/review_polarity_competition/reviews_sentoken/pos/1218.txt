Superlative performances by Mickey Rourke , Robert DeNiro and Lisa Bonet in a downright dark story make this one creepy , albeit excellent movie . The story line goes , Mickey Rourke 's character is a PI hired to find a person who disappeared 14 years ago . The story twists and turns and mixes in southern voodoo until it reaches a show-stopping climax.A little slow at times , which can make the complex plot tough to follow , but everything comes together in the end.Clearly one of the all time great underrated films .
