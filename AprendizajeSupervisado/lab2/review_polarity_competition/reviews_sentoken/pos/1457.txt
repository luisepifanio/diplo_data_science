Originally released for Christmas in 1935 , this splendidly produced , atmospheric and magnificently acted film displayed M-G-M 's flair for filming literary classics - DAVID COPPERFIELD was released earlier that year - with no expense spared ; the storming of the Bastille sequence employed several thousand extras and was filmed on one of Hollywood 's largest sets ever . Ronald Colman was intially reluctant to play the role of Sidney Carlton , that charming but dissolute lawyer who commits the ultimate self - sacrifice ... ... It took great persuasion to make Colman shave off his trademark moustache for the role of Carlton , but he delivered more than likely his finest performance ( Later in his life , Colman admitted this was his personal favourite of all his roles ) . Charles Dicken 's stirring classic of seventeenth-century Paris and London and the events surrounding the French Revolution had been filmed as silents on four different occasions -twice each in Great Britain and America - this easily remains the definitive masterpiece . Under Jack Conway 's meticulous direction , A TALE OF TWO CITIES offers memorable performances by a fine cast , including the marvelously hammy Blanche Yurka , frightening Lucille LaVerne , vinegary Edna May Oliver , despicable Basil Rathbone , eloquent Henry B. Walthall ( he was the `` Little Colonel '' in BIRTH OF A NATION ) and , in a radical change of pace , the dimunitive Isabel Jewell , as the pathetic seamstress who accompanies Colman to the place of his execution .
