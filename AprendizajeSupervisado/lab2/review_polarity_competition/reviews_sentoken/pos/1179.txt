I do love this workout ! It is a great program that takes about 45 minutes , and I can do when I do n't feel like getting out to the gym.I have danced most of my life so most of the exercises in the low-impact workout I am already familiar with , but the repetition is wonderful , and I am just a little sore the next day every time I do the low-impact workout.The high-impact workout is a different story . I have done it once since I have had the DVD and could hardly walk the next day ! ! This coming from a dancer who is in pretty good shape . The high-impact workout is mostly squats . As soon as I recover from the last time I did it , I will be doing it again because it feels great and is so good for you ! There is an additional workout for both arms and abs . Each set has Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders demonstrating . Three of the cheerleaders have been selected to perform beginner , intermediate , and advanced exercises , so you can choose which one you want to follow.The only thing I do n't care much for is that the coach who leads the workout talks a lot . He is very motivational , though , and especially people who are not very familiar with or motivated to workout I think would really benefit from that.I was hesitant to buy a workout DVD because of previous disappointment with them and lack of motivation to do them more than a few times , but this DVD is an exception.It is very fun , takes less than an hour out of my day , and I can choose exactly how intense or easy I want to take it from day to day . Highly recommended ! !
