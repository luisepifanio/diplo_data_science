This is one of the funniest and most poignant movies out there . Jessica Tandy was a treasure and Kathy Bates was so funny in a role that I certainly could identify with . I do want to correct some misinformation in a post two down from me ! Fannie Flagg IS the author of the book on which the movie is based ... but she is not Patricia Neal , the actress who starred in HUD . Patricia Neal was Fannie 's given name but when she went into acting , the name was obviously taken , so her father told her to make up a memorable name . Fannie Flagg is nothing if not memorable . She is a very funny lady ... and an excellent author . The movie is worth seeing over again .
