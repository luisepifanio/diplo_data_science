If you 've never seen THE EXORCIST , or have n't seen it in a long time , this is a great opportunity to add this classic horror film to your library ! The acting , directing , cinematography , sound track and special effects all stand up well to the test of time . Of special note is that both the special effects and the Tubular Bells music are still wonderful , not at all `` period . '' Max von Sydow is also particularly memorable as Father Merrin.The plot involves the possession of a 12-year-old girl by an ancient demon ( is there any other kind ) . Murder , a doubting priest , and a celebrity mom are tossed into the mix . It 's as chilling and realistic as you remember.Of special note- this DVD edition has about a dozen minutes of cutting room floor footage -- and it 's good stuff . It was omitted back in the day when films were usually limited to two hours . The staircase descent is particularly memorable , not to give away too much .
