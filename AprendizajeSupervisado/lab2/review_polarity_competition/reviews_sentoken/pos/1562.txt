The Crucible , based on Arthur Miller 's play , is an entertaining , if not always accurate version of the events in 1692 Salem Village . Having read numerous books on the subject I still can not say with any certainty what led to the events that so many men and women were accused of witchcraft and so many young girls seemed to be afflicted . One can question why it was only Salem 's females , and not males that seemed afflicted with screams , catatonic states , hallucinations , etc ... At any rate , one conclusion that I could not draw was that of a woman scorned , in this case Abigail Williams played by Winona Ryder whose advances are refused by the married John Proctor ( Daniel Day Lewis ) . The Proctors are also a good deal younger in the film than they were in real life . John was sixty when he was hung . Elizabeth would have been in her mid 40 's at the time of the trials . Pregnancy saved her from the hangman 's noose.The film does maintain a fair dose of accuracy in its treatment of the slave Tituba and her part in the whole affair as well as the accusations against some of the towns `` trouble makers '' such as goody Nurse and Giles Corey who was pressed to death for refusing to testify . The courtroom scenes were the most dynamic and exciting , and called to mind those period paintings from old books depicting the trials with stern , puritanical judges pointing accusing fingers . The film also did a good job of capturing that stifling , repressive 17th century setting and the costuming was first rate.The best performances for me came from those men portraying the various ministers and judges , particularly Bruce Davison as Reverend Parris and Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth . While not an entirely accurate film it still does a good job at capturing one of the seminal events in early American history.Reviewed by Tim Janson
