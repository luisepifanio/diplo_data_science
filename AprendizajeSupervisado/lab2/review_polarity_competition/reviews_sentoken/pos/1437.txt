This is one of my favourite film noirs , a great movie in which Welles showed the world he could do a classic Hollywood movie without going over the budget and still produce a genuine and personal masterpiece . I own two more previously released transfers of this public domain film , none of which did justice to the movie . They look like worn out VHS tapes . They are that bad . Finally , though without any extras and at a relatively high price , MGM has released what seems to be a transfer from a very good original 35 mm print , if not the original negative . The picture looks very clean and sharp , with deep blacks , and at last I can enjoy the film as Welles intended . Buy it .
