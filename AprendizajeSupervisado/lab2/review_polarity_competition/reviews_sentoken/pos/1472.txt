The Ten Commandments , The Buccaneer , Ben-Hur , El Cid , Planet of the Apes , all great Charlton Heston movies to be sure . But this movie , Mr. Heston 's performance as the passionate and complex Michelangelo Buonarroti , is without parallel in any of the previous or since roles he has played . His portrayal as the great artist is imtimate and shows a tender side . Futhermore , Rex Harrison as Pope Julius II is also extaordinary . The two men create a fine chemistry of the rebellious artist and the stern yet feeling pontiff who commissions Buonarroti to the great task of the Sistine . This performance peaks when the two men are standing beneath the great and not-yet-finished fresco late one night and reflect over the images of God and Adam-classic acting for certain . Please , buy it , rent it , just as long as you watch it . If you love art , I 'm sure you will love this .
