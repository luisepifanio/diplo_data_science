I have struggled with my weight since I was 13 and I am or have been the `` diet queen '' . Although I had all the tools of the trade so to speak ... I am a therapist and healer and coach myself ... . there used to be still a part within me that thought I had to `` conquer '' . In the last few months I dedicated time for myself , meditated every day , I bought the `` Getting into the vortex CD '' by Abraham which works along the same principles as the DVD describes ... . and after really looking after myself , accepting and loving myself exactly as I am , making my own happiness and alignment with Source most important , the weight dropped off . I am now slim , fit and healthy.When I got hold of the DVD I got really excited ... . as it is the Truth ! All change comes from within . I love that all presenters had struggled with their weight , so the teachings come from personal experience ... so it is very real.It is very precise , it gives you really good tips of how to turn your life around without focusing on your weight which is really just a symptom of not all being well in your world.This DVD is a gift to mankind ... . anybody who is serious about turning their life and their addiction to food around needs to watch it . I am now recommending it to my clients , I am creating a w/s centered around the DVD and have just passed on my copy to a governmental health organisation here in Australia. [ ... ]
