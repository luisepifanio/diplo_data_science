I ca n't remember the last time I was so entertained by a movie that I watched it three times within 24 hours . STILL CRAZY took me from my somber , somewhat starchy middle-age existence and transported me back to my college years in the Seventies , when I was in a ragtag part-time band . Make no mistake about it : this movie nails the chaotic , outlandish , self-absorbed , overbearing and irresistibly dysfunctional behavior of rock musicians . The antics of the characters -- even in middle age as they attempt to revive their careers -- brought back a plethora of memories . I , too , can recall gigs that had gone awry ; band members shouting chords at one another during a song ; the frequent & quot ; artistic & quot ; disagreements ; impromptu jam sessions in barns , garages , empty high school band rooms ; and the thrill of connecting with an audience ( usually a drunk audience ) .Buy this movie ... rent this movie ... see this movie . It 's more than just a comedy ; there is a very real human component that transcends even the tumultuous world of the music industry . You 'll laugh , you 'll brush away an occasional tear , and you 'll be thoroughly entertained.The flame still burns . God bless rock 'n roll !
