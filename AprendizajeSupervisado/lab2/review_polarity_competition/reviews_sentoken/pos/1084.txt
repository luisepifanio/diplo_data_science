Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic is , in my opinion , a well put-together masterpiece . It is a film that truly shows off the talent of its director and its stars in a completely interesting way . The acting is top-notch ( be sure to look for Don Cheadle and Louis Guzman as two DEA agents and Steven Bauer as a California drug lord ) and the cinematography is excellent . I would easily recommend Traffic to anyone interested in learning how to make a movie . 5 Stars
