The video takes you through the making of the album Electric Ladyland with the guys who played , engineered , gofered , or what have you . It is done on a song by song basis with lots of videos , photos and live performances . I am not a Hendrix fanatic , but I thought it was fascinating and very well done . If you are a Hendrix fanantic you would love this .
