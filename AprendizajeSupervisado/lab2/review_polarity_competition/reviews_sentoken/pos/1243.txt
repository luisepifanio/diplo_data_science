YOJIMBO was my introduction to the great body of work from the incomparable Japanese actor , Toshiro Mifune , who stars as the title character , Yojimbo ( English translation : Bodyguard ) . This man can be bought off with sake or rice , to basically do what he does best -- be physically imposing , and do away with the bad guys . Yet , he keeps his cool , even when he discovers that the couple who hired him is out to stab in the back ( I mean this as a figure of speech , of course ... .or do I ? haha ... .you 'll just have to see the film to find out , right ? ) .The great Japanese director , Akira Kurosawa , does a fantastic job of telling a compelling , quirky , darkly comedic and very engaging story . The jazzy , Japanese soundtrack and greatly reflects the themes and tensions in the storyline , the incidental camera work is spontaneous and teases the audience , while the actors grimace , growl and go after each other with vicious and ( at times ) reckless abandon . Fantastic ... ... By the way , this was the inspiration for the Spaghetti western , FISTFUL OF DOLLARS , starring Clint Eastwood . Not to be missed ... ... ..
