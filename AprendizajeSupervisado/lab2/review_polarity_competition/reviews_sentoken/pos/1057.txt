Max Beesley has got it going on . His and Mariah 's Chemistry was electric . I smiled , laughed and Cried . The first time I saw it is was Okay , but times 2-10 I keep seeing something new each time . This has become one of my favorite movies . It all comes down to It was a Romance , Success story , filled with emotion . I recommend this film as sweet entertainment . You 'll feel the emotion throughout the entire film . Give credit to the actors and do n't blame them for a less than perfect script , they did the best with what they were given . Max Beesley is dynamic , through the whole movie his eyes alone tell the underlying story .
