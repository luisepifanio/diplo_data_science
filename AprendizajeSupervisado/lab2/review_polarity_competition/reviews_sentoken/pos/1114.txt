This DVD was extremely helpful to me as a self-taught knitter who began with socks several months ago . The comfortable format of a mother and daughter sitting on a sofa discussing knitting and demonstrating various techniques was most useful . It is a joy to watch on so many levels . I love Elizabeth Zimmermann 's spirit and her daughter , Meg Swansen 's expertise . The well organized index allows easy access to the various techniques for later review . This DVD is jam packed with information as it 's very tightly edited and includes a wonderful interview at the end . I HIGHLY recommend this video to new and experienced knitter 's alike . I also bought the Knitting Workship DVD , but of the two , the Knitting Glossary is the most helpful .
