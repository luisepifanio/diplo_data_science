This is a wonderful film . Hopkins performance is a study in measured , method acting..it 's one of the best performances I have ever seen on film . The character is so structured and duty bound , he misses his one chance at happiness , it 's tragic and heartbreaking . The score is dead on and the movie perfectly captures the arrogance of the English aristocracy preceding World War II . The movie shows the way the classes interacted , and for an American , like me , this is fascinating..and so foreign . This DVD has some nice extra 's especially the deleted scenes . This is my personal favorite of the great Merchant-Ivory collaboration , though Howards End and Room With a View are great as well .
