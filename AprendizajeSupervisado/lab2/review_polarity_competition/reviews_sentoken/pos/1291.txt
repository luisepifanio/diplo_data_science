Robert Harmon 's `` The Highwaymen '' is a gripping fast-paced ride that grabs you in the first frames and does n't let you go until it has rattled your brains 81 minutes later . As Rennie , Jim Caviezel gives another soulful performance as the haunted husband who watches his wife run down by a hit & run driver and spends years chasing after the guy . Caviezel 's role is n't as demanding or as fulfilling as his performance as Catch in `` Angel Eyes , '' but it is well done . Colm Feore from `` Chronicles of Riddick , '' `` Paycheck '' & `` Chicago '' is menacing as the handicapped driver whose sole enjoyment in life is terrorizing and killing women with his car . I watched the film with an occupational therapist who had numerous comments about the portrayal of the handicapped . Rhona Mitra , who 's TV star has shined brightly in `` Party of 5 , '' `` Gideon 's Crossing , '' `` The Practice '' & now `` Boston Legal , '' does a great job of being pursued , scared and fighting back . She shows a number of levels , actually more demanding than her appearances in `` The Life of David Gale , '' `` Sweet Home Alabama '' or `` Get Carter . '' Frankie Faison who plays the traffic inspector has 4 films out this year and is a busy character actor ( White Chicks , Cookout ) . His police detective is a bit slow to pick up the gravity of what 's happening and becomes the complication to Rennie 's search , but eventually becomes an ally with the final parting shot . Andrea Roth as the blonde Alex does a nice but brief job before she 's embedded on the windshield of the Cadillac Eldorado . Yes , there are some plot holes and a few jumps in editing , but all in all this is a great little ride of a film . Enjoy !
