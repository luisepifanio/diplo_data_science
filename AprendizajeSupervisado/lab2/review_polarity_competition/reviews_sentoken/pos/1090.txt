This is still one of my favourite shows to this day . I really enjoy re-watching the episodes over and over again . This is the second to last season and it 's one of the better seasons.Obviously through the years , the kids are all growing up and maturing and that brings about some interesting situations . In the episode Fast Friends , Steph hangs out with kids that smoke and make her feel pressured to do the same . I also like The Apartment where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch . Danny finds her ( after she 's late coming home ) and gets pretty angry.Full House is such a great show that I 'm sure young kids today would still like , and older 'kids ' like me still like because I grew up watching it . There 's never been a cooler ( or cuter ) uncle than Uncle Jesse , and the love between all the family is great and fun to watch . This is one of the better seasons and any fan should definately have this in their collection .
