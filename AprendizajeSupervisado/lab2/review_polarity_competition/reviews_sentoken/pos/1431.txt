Soap is being repeated on cable , Paramount in the UK Sept 04 and is as hilarious as ever , great scripts , great actors , hilarious situations and laugh out loud one-liners . All my family from ages 12 upwards love it and empathise with the characters.Seeing it again has prompted me to buy the DVD 's and hope that the other series are released as soon as possible.Todays script writers of soaps should look to attain this standard of writing
