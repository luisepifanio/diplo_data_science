Great Milestones is an exploration into the breeding habits and mating rituals of various types of animals . Interesting aspects of this subject are how the Moon and tides regulate and synchronize certain elements of breeding and how weather conditions also play a part . Not only are land animals studied , but some types of undersea creatures are shown as well.In the latter half of this documentary , parents protecting and feeding their newborns is touched upon . Finishing up is a look at the young animals leaving the home or nest in the struggle to join the circle of life.At only 60 minutes long , this feature may leave you wishing for more . The sound , narration , and video are quite well done in my opinion . No bonus features are offered except for a couple of trailers from other programs . The chapters are a bit short due to the time limit but what is presented is entertaining and pleasant nonetheless . As diverse as the animal kingdom is , here 's hoping that Reader 's Digest will make more of these types of documentaries . If you 're a fan of this type of subject matter , this is recommended viewing .
