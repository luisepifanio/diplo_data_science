Harvey Pekar 's comic book , American Splendor pioneered a new genre : the autobiographical comic book . At first glance , the everyday events of a file clerk from Cleveland seem hardly the material for an interesting film . Fortunately , filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to take what was funny , heart-breaking and fascinating about Pekar 's life and successfully adapt from the panels on the page to the big screen . Like Ghost World , American Splendor champions outsiders who do n't fit in with mainstream society.In a nice touch , a mini-comic book comes with the DVD that briefly chronicles Pekar 's experience with having his comic book adapted into a movie.The disc itself features an engaging audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar , his wife Joyce , their daughter Danielle , his friend Toby Radloff , filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman , and actor Paul Giamatti . Everyone has a lot of fun on this track as they joke and reminiscence about the film and their experiences . `` Road to Splendor '' is a brief update on what Harvey has been up to since the film was made.The song , `` American Splendor , '' by Eytan Mirsky that was featured in the movie can be listened to in its entirety . His vocals sound uncannily like Evan Dando from the Lemonheads.Finally , there is a theatrical trailer for the movie.American Splendor has the same ironic sense of humour and melancholy as Ghost World , another excellent cinematic adaptation of an independent comic book . American Splendor stays true to Pekar 's vision-it refuses to sentimentalize his life , even at the film 's emotional conclusion which is genuinely moving . It is one of the finest comic book adaptations ever put on film because it remains true to its source material and wisely involves its creator in the process of transferring his story from the page to the screen .
