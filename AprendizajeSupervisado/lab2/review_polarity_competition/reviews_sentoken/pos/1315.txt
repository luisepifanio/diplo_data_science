It is too bad that Bruce Willis ca n't crank out this films more often . John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in all film history and this installment packs a wallop with a slew of action and humor.McClain is asked to bring a suspected computer hacker to be interviewed by the FBI . The actor playing this hacker is the guy who does the Apple McIntosh comercials . It is interesting to note that he seem to prefer a Mac in this one . Anyway , McClain shows up just as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys . Were it any other movie it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire , but being a Die Hard movie the bad guys come with ultra modern machine guns . Of course McClain is able to take some of them out and temporarily get away with the hacker . Thus we have the makings of a great partnership as good as any to the Lethal Weapons movies.The movie has you cheering throughout , especially when McClain taunts the head bad guy about offing one of his key henchpersons and then telling him I 'm coming to get you.Kevin Smith has a larger cameo as Warlock , a live at home with his mother computer hacker . It is a role that seems to have been made for him.This is the best Die Hard since the first movie !
