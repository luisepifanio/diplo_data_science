I remember when i was younger going to see this film with my brother and sisters and really enjoying it this extended cut of big is as great as the original cinema cut with an additional 25 minutes of footage not included in the original release the deleted scenes on the second disc are just the extra scenes that are in the extended cut but with the option of watching either cut of the film on the 1st disc it has to be a great buy and being a buyer from the uk i am pleased that i bought this release as 1 of my 1st ever imports
