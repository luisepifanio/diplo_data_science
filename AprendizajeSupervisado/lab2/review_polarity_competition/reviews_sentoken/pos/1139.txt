What I loved most about this film is it 's lack of & quot ; message & quot ; or agenda . Other then telling a great story this film had nothing to & quot ; prove & quot ; . There were no tearfelt speeches for aids victims , no angst about the pain of coming out , just great characters engaged in a funny offbeat script ( with dialouge as good as any by Neal Simon ) that works . There are many complicated plot elements that all come together nicely and that 's not easy to do . The way the writer ties the lead characters struggle to finish his song with the rest of the plot is brilliant . I also differ with the criticism of a previous writer who claimed the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in & quot ; reality & quot ; . One could see from J.P. Pitoks admirable performance that the character was more then just a beefcake . In fact i thought they made a really cute realistic couple not in spite of but BECAUSE of their differences . The ending scene of them walking down the street said it all ... ..Gabriel could n't shut up , and Mark could n't speak . But laughed in the right places . A great film . The fact that no & quot ; message & quot ; is needed shows that the gay community might be beginning to feel more accepted .
