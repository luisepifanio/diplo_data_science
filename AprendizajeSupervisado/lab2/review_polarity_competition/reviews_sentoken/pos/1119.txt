I had seen this movie on the shelves for years and always said , `` oh I need to rent that '' and just never did . So , I bought it off Amazon since it would be cheaper than me renting anything , since I always end up with late fees . Anyway , I really enjoyed it . It 's just a fun light hearted movie that has a good message . I definantly recommend watching the movie .
