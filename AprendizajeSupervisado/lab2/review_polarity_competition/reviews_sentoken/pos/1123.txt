This is the greatest SPACE movie of all time , without any reasonable doubt . Tom Hanks , Kevin Bacon , Bill Paxton , Gary Sinise , Ed Harris , and Kathleen Quinlan ALL give superb performances . I really like the way they were able to make an old story exciting without taking much dramatic license . This movie actually makes you FEEL as if you 're with Jim Lovell , Fred Haise , and Jack Swigert in their desperate battle to stay alive in their crippled space craft 200,000 miles from safety , or with Lovell 's wife and family as they sit by and hope for the best , or with Gene Kranz and other mission control ground crew members struggle to bring them home . This is still Ron Howard 's best film as a director . Anyone who wishes to see an historical adventure movie should look no further than APOLLO 13 . It 'll make you feel great , trust me ! Grade : A+
