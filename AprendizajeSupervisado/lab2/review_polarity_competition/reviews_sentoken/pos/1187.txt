This is a typical quirky comedy from the sixties ! Some may like it , and some may not.But , if you 're a Mini Cooper fan , or merely a car enthusiast ( the opening scene , with a Lamborghini Miura driving thru the italian Alps is awesome ! ) , you have to see this film ! The Mini Coopers are the real stars in this film ! The already mentioned Lamborghini Miura , a DB-4 Aston Martin , a Daimler , a couple of E-type Jaguars , and a bunch of late sixties italian cars such as Alfa Romeos and FIATs are the supporting stars ! This is undoubtedly a car enthusiast 's film ! A must for Mini Cooper lovers !
