Right on the money . Does n't miss a beat . Creative writing and great performances . The humour and occassional drama come in subtle waves . The boy in this story is definitely the character of Hugh Grant and to the story 's credit a second boy , who is of age to be an authentic boy is introduced . He walks into Grant 's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men . Instead of going for broad comedy the script is more subtle , focusing on people 's dilemmas , contradictions , hypocrisies and even finding humour in their tragic failures . It 's really a drama that takes everything very seriously . But because it sees the light at the end of the tunnel , very clearly it teaches us that when life presents an end to something , it also offers a beginning to something else . Let 's embrace it !
