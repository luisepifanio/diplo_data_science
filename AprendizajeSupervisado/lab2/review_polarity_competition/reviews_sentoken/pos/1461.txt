Donald O'Connor plays Aladdin as both the hero and comic relief in this arabian nights fantasy . Conspicuously American in a cast that seems largely European , O'Connor 's Aladdin is of humble origins but never allows his lack of means ( or any concrete ideas for acquiring any ) dampen his dreams of grandeur . When he finds that his new lamp contains a genie who 'll grant him three wishes , his chance for greatness may have finally come true . Nobody believes him , least of all the lovely Djalma , who has spent years waiting for him to give up his dreams , settle down and marry her . Assured of his deepest wishes , Aladdin travels to Basorah , a great city nearby , which already celebrates the impending marriage of the Sultan 's daughter to the young but wise Molook . Meanwhile , the prince 's wicked Vizier conspires to kill Mollook and steal both his crown and his bride and , with no male heirs of the Sultan , the Sultan 's crown as well . When blundering across the plan , Aladdin rides to an unlikely rescue with the help of the wily prince and Basorah 's population of fakirs and beggars.This was a fun flick and for some reason overlooked . It 's okay for kids , not really violent ( except for two scenes , both involving a doll made to look like a real and exotically beautiful woman , and designed to crush to death those who blunder into its embrace ) and manages to look both very Hollywood and also very convincingly Arabian at the same time . Donald O'Connor manages to steal every scene he 's in . This was the sort of flick that used to be on TNT every couple of months , but has n't been on in years , so get this tape .
