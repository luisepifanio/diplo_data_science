My kids love this movie and they watch it on sleep-overs with their friends . Don Knotts plays Luther Hegg , a timid typesetter in a small town in the mid-west ( Rachel , Kansas ) . The supporting actors are first rate : Skip Homeier , Dick Sargent , Ellen Corby etc . Joan Staley , who plays Alma , was the centerfold for PLAYBOY in 1958 ! Vivian Vance 's ex hubby Phil Ober plays the murderer and the old women in the boarding house are hilarious . Reta Shaw is very funny as the head of the Psychic Society and Vic Muzzy 's musical score is cornily creepy . When this picture was first released in theatres in l965 , it was a huge hit in small towns across the U.S. and it is very representitive of 1960 's small town Americana . Fun !
