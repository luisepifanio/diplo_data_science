This DVD attempt to cram into about an hour the entire history of North American exploration . Given its aim , I believe it does quite a decent job of doing so . It summarized five hundred years of history and many dozen expeditions and explorers into brief tidbits of information . I do n't think this is a good educational tool , since it would likely be somewhat uninteresting -- it does not have very interesting stories , just a stream of information . Rather , this is a good starting point to someone wishing to research North American exploration and would like an intro to the main events and people in its history . Not really something to excite people about history , people seeing this should already be excited .
