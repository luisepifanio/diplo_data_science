After reading user MOUSEENEER 'S review , boy am I glad I did n't wait for the uncut version , although I had it on Laserdisc , I did n't feel like it added that much more scope to the film , the only thing that is different is the murder scene at the beginning is a little more graphic , Michael Douglas & Sharon Stone 's sex scene is a little more revealing , ( he performs oral sex on her that is quite vivid ) , other than that this film is the same as the R-version , this is one hell of a psychological roller-coaster ride , but it is a good one , it may be perceived as a sex movie , but it is a police thriller that keeps you guessing till the end , & still your not sure who the killer is , it has been said in the media that Douglas & Stone hated each other on this film ( that they could not get along ) although you ca n't tell by watching , it would not be hard to believe , given the ego 's of both Douglas & Stone , despite this , it is a very good police thriller that should not be ignored , & Sharon Stone looks her best here , I ca n't honestly say now , since she cut off her long blond hair ( not wise ) but here she shines as Catherine Trammel , a role that Julia Roberts turned down , Stone is perfect here & this will always be her best role .
