A story within a story on a cruise ship - the surface story is of a ` seven year itch ' . A staid and respectable , childless British couple celebrating that volitile aniversary , are heedlessly advised ( in regard to the husband anyway ) by an Indian sage that children are better marital therapy than a cruise to India . Lust takes over the seemingly conservative Brit played perfectly by Hugh Grant and makes a fool of him . Yes this happens to men all the time.On said cruise the British couple run into the sexy French siren and her crippled , older , storytelling husband who latches on to the Brit husband to tell his never-published autobiographical novel slash cautionary tale . And as for the interior story of the writer and his French obsession , it shows how ` greediness ' for hedonistic fantasy can lead to dark , sadististic or at least regrettable behavior . Suffice to say , everyone learns this lesson in their own way in the end.A subtle theme here is the portrayal of the failed writer , who buys into fantasy too strongly and tries to make life imitate art until both his life and art fall short of any success , ( this , like the lust in the male seven year itch , is another truism - failed artists often go too far into fantasy forgoing realism which ultimately causes frustration and failure ) other than telling his story orally to one mere chump on a cruise who completely misses the point and is ready to cash in his perfectly respectable life for a brief scandalous trist in the very manner that made the cripple such an abomiable obnoxious loser . Much like the Siren song from Homer ( who was also cruising the Mediteranian , was n't he ? ) Great score by Vangelis too , capturing romance and tragedy in one theme .
