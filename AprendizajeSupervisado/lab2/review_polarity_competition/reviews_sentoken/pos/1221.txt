This DVD gives you amazing performances by some of the best out there : Sheryl Crow , Shawn Colvin , the Indigo Girls , and Sarah Mclachlan are all brilliant , and Meredith Brooks and Jewel are in fine form too . The interviews are great , and the backstage jam session with Crow and the Indigo Girls -- they 're teaching her & quot ; Tried to be True & quot ; -- is a little gem that ( as another reviewer noted ) captures the spirit of Lilith Fair beautifully . On the technical end : the camera work is marvelous , with closeups and great angles for that you-are-there feeling . In fact I would have given this DVD 5 stars but for the occasionally spotty sound . I ca n't comment on the 5.1 because I 've only got stereo . But be forewarned that at times the volume drops suddenly and inexplicably ; and in a couple of places , the muddy mix cheats the listener , as in the closing moments of Crow 's otherwise gorgeous & quot ; I Shall Believe. & quot ; Even so , I would n't have missed this for anything . More , please .
