There are a lot of scenes in this movie which really tell the truth about how secretaries are treated in the American workplace . One scene that sticks in my mind is when Griffith 's character tracks down an executive who has received an important call . The executive gets mad with her for disturbing him and asks why did n't she give the customer the information . & quot ; He do n't want to hear it from a secretary , & quot ; she says . Anybody who 's ever wanted to get ahead but have been victims of class snobbery and arrogance in the workplace will relate to this movie . Weaver is perfect as the ice queen executive who makes things hard for Griffith . Ford is amicable in his role . Watch for Kevin Spacey in a small role .
