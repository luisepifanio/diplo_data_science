I 've been a FIRM Believer since the 80 's , and while I understand some of the earlier comments about this tape being too easy , I recommend giving it a second try . At first , because the choreography can be challenging , the workout may not seem too intense . You 're too darn busy trying to figure out what step comes next . But once you get the steps down , you can maximize your effort , and the workout will become difficult . Plus , you can always heavy up ( within reason ) during the dumbell exercises . This will raise your heart rate as well.I 'm a FIRM veteran , and I look forward to doing this tape . : o )
