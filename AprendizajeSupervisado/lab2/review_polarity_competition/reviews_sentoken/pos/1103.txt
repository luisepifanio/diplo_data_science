this movie was one of the most shocking things I have ever seen . I knew that animals were treated badly , but didnt think it went to this extent . This film gets to the bottom of industry abuse of farmers , and other employees , it will motivated you to go vegetarian . I would also recommend the film `` Blue Gold : world water wars '' it uncovers the problems of our mass use of water .
