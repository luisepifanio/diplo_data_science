There is no question that this is Presley at his best ever . He is 35 years old and has never looked or sounded better . the sad thing with this version is that some of the songs have been edited out . I just ca n't help believing , I 've lost you and Bridge over troubled water live on stage versions . As the other 's he does an excellent job woth these also . wish they had left them in . hopefully we can get another version or another dvd with all the other footage there must be .
