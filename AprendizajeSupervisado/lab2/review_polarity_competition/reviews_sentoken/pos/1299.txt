As a child of the 70 's , Schoolhouse Rock was as much of a Saturday morning tradition as pajamas , cartoons , and cereal . Now , as a fourth grade teacher , I have rediscovered the value of these timeless cartoons . What was once simple entertainment wedged between The Wonder League and various other ABC cartoons is now a valuable educational tool ! Each year my students learn and memorize the Preamble to the Constitution thanks to Schoolhouse Rock . And how interesting would the American Revolution be without No More Kings , Fireworks , or The Shot Heard 'Round the World ? From a fourth grader 's perspective , NOT VERY ! This DVD is a must have for students , teachers , and parents . This fun , entertaining quick review of these necessary skills is a great way to learn with your kids/students . After all , how else would we know that a conjunction 's purpose is , `` Hooking up words and phrases and clauses '' ?
