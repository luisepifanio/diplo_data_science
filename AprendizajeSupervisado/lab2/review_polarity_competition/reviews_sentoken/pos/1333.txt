i was dating the wonderfull Miss Luckey when this film was made.Damn , i should have married that girl.so it is for personal reasons that i continue to watch and rewatch this film ( and Oklahoma ) . But i had not seen the dvd until recently and it is greater than ever . i loved the & quot ; making of the movie & quot ; clip . This film is just fun all the way through . no low huggers , no cleavage , no four letter words . God how would it be received now ? oh , well , we always will have the dvd .
