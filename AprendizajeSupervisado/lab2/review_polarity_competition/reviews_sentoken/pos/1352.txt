I love Bing Crosby , he was such a natural , there has never been anyone since with as much talent except Fred Astaire , they are truly the best in what they did , This collection is great if you love Bing Crosby and appreaciate his talent the way I do , the acting is ok not terriffic , but it is entertainment and there were no special effects back then so they had to have actual talent and I for one so appreciate it , to hear Bing sing is always a wonderful treat ! ! ! I love the old black and whites if it is not black and white and looks original , I am not interested , the quality of this collection is wonderful so clear and to have these good old movies preserved , is the best ! ! thanks for a great product and the shiiping was quick and I got it a day ahead of what was scheduled and I was ready to watch them that night ! ! !
