This film is about real people with real weight and medical issues that change their lives . Truly inspirational . This film kept my attention the entire time and I even learned a few things . I highly recommend for even those that are already physically fit , etc . ( as I am ) . I shall insist my none healthy AND healthy friends watch . The bottom line ; junk food will kill you one way or another !
