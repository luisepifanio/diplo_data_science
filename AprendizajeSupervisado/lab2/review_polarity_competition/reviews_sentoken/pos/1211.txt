Having not really seen this until I bought both the first and second seasons for my wife , I was pleasantly surprised by it . Makes for great Sunday afternoon viewing . Angela is very entertaining and the `` I ca n't believe that they looked like that '' factor of the guest stars is always good for a laugh .
