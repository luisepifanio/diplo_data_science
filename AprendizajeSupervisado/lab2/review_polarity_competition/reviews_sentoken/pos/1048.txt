I would recommend this film for adults and children alike . It has something of interest for all age groups . There is beautiful and awe inspiring Southwestern scenery , as the story takes place in the southwestern Arizona desert , on Navajo lands . There is a story as well , of two young boys who have lost their goat , and they think it has wandered into a canyon known as & quot ; Cougar Canyon & quot ; a place that is supposed to be haunted , according to Navajo legend . They must go in to find the goat , of course , and are beset by many dangerous mishaps before they successfully fulfill their mission . The real stars of this film , though , besides the beautiful scenery , is the superb photography of the desert wildlife in it 's natural habitat . There is a battle between a badger and a cougar , or wildcat , as it is more commonly known , with a suprise ending . The close-ups of a diamondback rattle snake is awesome , and the narration is superb , also . This movie is reminiscent of the old Disney Nature Documentary series that used to come on television years ago , back in the 70 's . I enjoyed it immensely , and I am a senior citizen , but I can see where it would appeal to children as well , as they are usually fascinated with wild creatures like rattle snakes , wild cats , black bears , etc . in their natural surroundings . It is actually very educational , especially to us city dwellers . I ca n't say enough good things about this film , you will just have to see it for yourself .
