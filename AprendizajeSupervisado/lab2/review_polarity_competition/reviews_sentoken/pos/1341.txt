As a former Marine and Vietnam veteran , I have to disagree with Mr. Brennan 's portrayal of the second half of this film . The war scenes were marginal at best and failed to capture the `` realism '' of war ... Platoon was much better in that respect . Primarily because Oliver Stone was a veteran , himself . However the boot camp scenes in FMJ were dead on accurate . R.Lee Ermey played the Drill Instructor to perfection , as he should have , having been the very same in real life . I had several D.I . 's like this in boot camp and I can assure you , it WAS this way during the Vietnam war . I can laugh at the movie now , but while in boot camp it was no laughing matter , we were there to learn to fight and go to war , other skills were learned , but they were secondary . We had to be tough and they made sure we were . The boot camp portion was almost like a documentary to me ! Having said all that , the movie was like two parts to me.The first half and the second half . With one being dead on and the other only so so and completely based on a Hollywood perception of what the war was like . For those who were not there , trust me ... It was much different than this version . Overall , because of R. Lee Ermey 's performance and Vincent D'Onofrio I give it 4 stars .
