After all of the hype about this film I expected something completely different . The documentary was more about the White family and barely focused on Jesco . With The Dancing Outlaw Jesco was the spotlight and seemed to be the worst off of the family when it came to mental state , however in this one he seems to be the only sane one.Documentaries are made to provoke emotion whether it be happiness , sorrow , hatred , love , or whatever , documentaries are made for that reason . This one completely succeeded , however not in the way I imagined . I could n't help thinking how much of a disgrace this family is to D Ray White and West Virginia . They openly brag about shooting people , killing people , selling drugs , prescription fraud , and snort pills in front of their newborn baby ( which CPS takes away , thank God ) . It disgusted me , but that is what this documentary was meant to do.I loved it , I am a huge Jesco White fan and thought it was as good as The Dancing Outlaw . I just feel that Dickhouse Pictures sort of exploited this dysfunctional family in the name of 'Legacy ' , which I guess is legit ... but not cool.I definitely recommend it fully , however it does play like part 'Intervention ' episode , part COPS and part Gummo . Sometimes it seemed a bit fake , however the fact that it was real sort of shocks you for a second . If that makes sense.It 's basically like a car accident.The soundtrack is also great with Hank III , Lefty Frizzell & GG Allin .
