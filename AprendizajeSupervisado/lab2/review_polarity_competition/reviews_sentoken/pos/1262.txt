The review you see above , the amazon review I must say is a load of crap . I just saw the movie today , and I went in to watch this movie with pretty low expectations , expecting a cheap thrill is over the top guns fights and a story a six year old could have written in 5 minutes . However , I was pleasantly surprised after the first fight scene to see that there was indeed a story , and contrary to what I thought , it was surprisingly deep and very well done . The review above , the amazon review caught my attention by stateing that the fight scene was stupid for the fight was spurred by a puppy . And if I had not seen the movie , I would have probably agreed that fighting over a puppy is pretty stupid story wise , however , if you watch the scene , it is actually quite moving , hearing the dogs getting killed and than introducing a view of a innocent puppy going up to a cold blooded killer and stirring something up inside of the clerick . I could go on longer , however , I will not , I will wrap up this review by saying that this is very high quality movie magic . Action scenes to droll over , a story that 'll make you think be grateful for emotions , and an ending that 'll make you really smile from ear to ear . If you want to spend your money well , you 'll be wise to spend it on a movie of this high caliber .
