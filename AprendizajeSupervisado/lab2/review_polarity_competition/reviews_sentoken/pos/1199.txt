I was just beginning my life long passion with music in '67 when I ran across Buckley . His early albums mesmerized me and I 've never been without some incarnation of the first three since , either LP or CD . When LORCA came out I went with it up to a point , but admit I totally lost the thread of where Buckley was going by STARSAILOR . This DVD , which presents a very nice span of clips from throughout his career gives a new appreciation to all phases of an artist who pushed the creative envelope hard ( achieving damn near commercial suicide in the attempt ) . When I watched the later era performances I felt guilty for abandoning Buckley in his later phases , but it takes a maturity to appreciate this material I did n't have at the time . Now I find it inspiring , magical , transcendent.The DVD is a `` must have '' for anyone with an interest in this amazing talent , and it 's great to finally see these performances in high quality .
