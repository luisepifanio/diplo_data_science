One of the most enjoyable films of the 80s is Big , in which Tom Hanks ... well , you already know by now.I liked almost everything about this 2-disc set.One MAJOR gotcha , however . Or maybe two , depending on how you look at it.If you play the Extended Cut ( Disc 1 ) with the Commentary set to On , you get a ) no commentary , and b ) a Spanish soundtrack.If you play the Theatrical version with Commentary set to On , you get essentially nothing BUT commentary . No dialog from the film can be heard , as far as I could tell.Playing Theatrical or Extended versions with Commentary set to Off is just fine.The Extras disc is nice , but the aforementioned flaws should truly be addressed .
