While I agree that the marketing strategy for the US and Canadian release of Kate & Allie left a lot to be desired , I am happy that these wonderful episodes made it to DVD at all . The casting , the writing , the acting ... Watching these shows feels like coming home ... and I have lived in Norway all my life !
