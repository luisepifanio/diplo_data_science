I thought this was a really effective learning product . You are able to rewind if you miss something and the more you play it the better you get . They teach a wide variety of words in sign and I found this to be excellent . Do not buy the other DVD `` Say it with Sign '' . It is not as well put together and it is very repetive . I found it to be confusing and useless . This one is awesome .
