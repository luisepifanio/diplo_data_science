I 'm a great fan of this show . I started watching because of Christian Kane ( plays the hitter Eliot Spencer ) but I fell in love with the whole team and the smart stories immediately . So I waited impatiently for the DVD . But I 'm a little bit disappointed.I 'm not a nativ speaker that 's why I have sometimes problems to get every word and every joke ( I understand most of it ) and I was looking forward to see the show with subtitles , but there are none.And I could only find deleted scenes of two episodes , thought there would be more . And also no bloopers . But there are some other specials.So , it 's still a lot of fun to watch the show now in DVD quality , but I only give four stars because of the missing subtitles .
