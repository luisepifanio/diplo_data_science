I enjoyed the special features as much as the episodes . Some of the guest stars that appeared on Bonanza gave running commentaries on the episode they were in . It was interesting how they explained where the episode was filmed and how they did the special effects . They all said the Bonanza stars were a pleasure to work with and everyone on the set was nice . David Dortort , the creator of Bonanza gave interesting interviews too . I especially liked his interview called `` Remembering Pernell Roberts '' . The photo gallery contains photos of the stars at their homes . The episodes are uncut with scenes never seen before on TV . I would highly recommend this DVD for any Bonanza fan .
