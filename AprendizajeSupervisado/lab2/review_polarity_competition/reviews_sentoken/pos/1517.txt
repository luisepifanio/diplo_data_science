The adventures of three girls in show-business . ZIEGFELD GIRL is an immense backstage musical into which MGM poured tons of talent ; it also marked Pandro S. Berman 's first assignment with that studio after his years of success at RKO . Just why Jimmy Stewart received top-billing for this rather uneven but entertaining movie is a mystery - his role is virtually a minor one . Robert Z. Leonard directed this two and a quarter hours worth of stuggle , triumph , pain and music , but the two big production numbers , MINNIE FROM TRINIDAD and YOU STEPPED OUT OF A DREAM , were the work of the fabled wizard of cinematic choreography , Busby Berkeley . Judy is darling as Susan Gallagher and her scenes with her Irish Pop ( Charles Winninger ) are realistically executed . I felt Lana Turner 's performance is a bit artificial and inept in her acting technique ; she plays Sheila who succumbs to the bottle . As Sandra , Lamarr is astonishingly beautiful , but her acting hardly lingers in one 's memory ! Jimmy Stewart would enlist himself in the Army before this film premiered ; he would n't make another film until 1946 ; it was a sleeper ( just kidding ) entitled IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE .
