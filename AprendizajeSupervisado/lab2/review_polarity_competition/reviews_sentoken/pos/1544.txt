Lewis Gilbert 's 1983 masterpiece , a sensitive and emotionally-satisfying adaptation of Willy Russel 's intelligent and insightful two-character play . Gilbert and Russel would team up again for the wonderful & quot ; Shirley Valentine , & quot ; but their work in this film remains unparalleled . Michael Caine gives one of the most memorable performances in an illustrious career , disappearing into his Frank character , and Julie Walters is magnificent as Rita/Susan . The music by David Hentschel is perfectly appropriate , the cinematography by Frank Watts is inspired , the script is both touching and honest , but the magic of this film is in the interplay between the two main characters . This film captures the journey towards self-awareness embodied in education , as the Rita/Susan character develops from hairdresser to student , intellectual , dilitante , and finally into someone very different than at the start of the film yet still undeniably and uniquely & quot ; Rita. & quot ; The greatest gift one person can give another is the love of learning , and thus I feel this is among the greatest love stories ever committed to celluloid . The ending might be & quot ; as inevitable as tragedy , & quot ; in the words of Willy Russel , but the relationship between Frank and Rita made their emotional journey worthwhile , and we are all the richer for their trip .
