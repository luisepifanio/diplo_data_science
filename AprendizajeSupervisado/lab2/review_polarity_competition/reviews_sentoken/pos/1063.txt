I RECENTLY HEARD OF TRACY ANDERSON AS BEING MADDONAS TRAINER SO I WENT TO HER WEBSITE WICH BY THE WAY IS VERY NICE , AND SAW SHE HAD WORKOUT DVDS FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT LIVE IN LOS ANGELES . I WENT TO AMAZON TO SEE REVIEWS FIRST AND MOST REVIEWS ARE VERY POSITIVE SOME SAY THE WORKOUT IS HORRIBLE AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY . I DONT KNOW WHERE THEY GOT THAT FROM I ORDERED THE CARDIO AND MAT WORKOUT I LOVE HOW SHE EXPLAINS THE CARDIO PART SO FOR THOSE WHO SAY SHE DOES NOT TALK WHILE THE CARDIO DANCE IS ON OFCOURSE HOW CAN SHE TALK WHEN SHE IS DANCING LIKE THAT AND SHE ALREADY TALKED AND EXPLAINED THE CHOREOGRAPHY IN THE INTRODUCTION .FOR THIS WORKOUT YOU NEED TO PRACTICE AND ENJOY DANCING I LOVE THE WORKOUT THE MUSIC AND HER STUDIO SETTING YOU FEEL LIKE A STAR . ALSO THE MAT DVD IS AWSOME YOU NEED TO BUY THE 2 DVD TO GET RESULTS AND ITS WORTH THE BUY IF YOU REALLY PUT THE TIME AND EFFORT . I HOPE LATER ON SHE DOES MORE DVDS .
