This is a great movie . I saw it in the theater and knew I would have to have the DVD . It shows MJ as a real person with a great sense of humor and respect for his musicians and the knowledge of his music . This is great opportunity to see MJ with out all that media hype that has plaqued him for years . Highly recommended .
