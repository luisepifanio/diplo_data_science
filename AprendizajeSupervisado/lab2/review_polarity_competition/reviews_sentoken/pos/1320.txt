Peter Brooks ' spartan adaptation of William Golding 's immortal novel about a group of English schoolboys stranded on a desserted island still works nearly four decades after its initial release . Despite a total lack of star names and limited production values , the film succeeds thanks to yeoman performances from the child actors and an overall primitivism that makes the whole imminently believable . At first the castaways do n't seem to have it so bad ; there 's plenty of food , no grownups , and no predators ... except for perhaps one , a & quot ; beastie & quot ; that might be a weird animal or a ghost or something far worse ... A moving , ever-poignant indictment of inherent human savagery , Lord of the Flies succeeds in translating the essence of Golding 's tale to the screen . Like so many adults , the children think they 're good enough to make their own utopia . So much for utopia . So much for childhood innocence .
