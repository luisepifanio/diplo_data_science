The following story will tell you why this movie bombed at the box office.While visiting family in Miami one of my cousins went to see the movie . When he got home he was telling me how much the movie stunk . As he was talking it became obvious to me that he had taken the movie seriously . So I yelled at him `` It 's a parody ! ! He 's making fun of action movies in general and himself in particular ! ! '' I could see the lightbulb go on over his head and he went right out and saw it again.Needless to say , he loved the film . As do I . It 's not often that a big star has the guts to make fun of himself just to make his fans laugh . So if you have this film languishing in your collection somewhere you need to see it with this in mind . It 's parody . Satire . Comedy ! Watch it and have fun .
