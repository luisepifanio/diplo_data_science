My 20 months old daughter loves it . She is dancing with the songs . Out of 20 DVD she has , she always pick this one and put it in the DVD player herself . After 1 month , she has scratch this DVD badly because she wo n't let us put it in the DVD player . We have to go buy another one to replace it .
