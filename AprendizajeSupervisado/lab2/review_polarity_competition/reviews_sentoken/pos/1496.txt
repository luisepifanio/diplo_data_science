For years I have not bothered too much with 'movies ' , not liking much of the cliched hollywood drivel . But since getting a DVD player I have also found myself going to the cinema . What a treat to see SNATCH . Brilliantly funny writing , superbly executed by the actors , realistic dialogue , believeable characterisations . Fast moving , sub-plots neatly interwoven , casting brilliant , all in all superb . I came out of the cinema having laughed myself stupid whilst at the same time having enjoyed a storyline which was both simple to follow but complex in makeup . Guy Ritchie has done a great job on this , the cast was superbly chosen , even Brad Pitt , who , heretofore , has not been a particular favourite of mine . I have now also bought the DVD , two disks , masses of extras , have watched it four times , cant watch again , my ribs wont stand the pummelling they take . I recommend this to all . To our American cousins , I think it is only recently released , go and see it now , you will love it .
