I will not dispute what the other reviewers here have said , it 's all that and more . Oh , and FORGET that hideous `` We Are The World '' crap , it was just an ego-trip for B. Geldof . OK , that being said , please allow me to just highlight my favorite part of `` Bangla Desh '' : Leon Russell 's rendition of `` Jumpin ' Jack Flash '' ( giving the Rolling Stones at least perfuntory `` exposure '' here ) coupled with that GREAT old Coasters ' chestnut , `` Youngblood . '' It 's great , seeing Leon kind of jumpstart the other musicians with a most uptempo number - but my very favorite part is the segue between `` JJF '' and `` Youngblood , '' and then - especially then - seeing and hearing ex- '' Mother , '' Don Preston , almost unrecognizable with straight hair , sing the `` bridge '' in `` Youngblood , '' the part where he sings , `` Hey , crazy little stuff ... '' THAT is Rock And Roll , folks .
