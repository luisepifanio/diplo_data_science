For those of us who watch anime and are of many different opinions as to what is and is n't good , I must say that GWLTT was one of the few anime feature films in a while that can hold itself up without the typical anime movie formula to grab as many people as possible . What grabbed me the most about GWLTT was its lack of being the typical anime and simply being a movie , which is something few can claim . I 'd consider GWLTT to be a breath of fresh air to an industry that seems to need it . But for the non-anime watcher I would say this is a good choice to start off with if you have n't seen much or have just got started . For the anime fan this is a flick to add to the collection .
