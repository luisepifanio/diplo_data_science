& quot ; Return of the Living Dead & quot ; is a hilarious horror/comedy inspired by George A. Romero 's classic & quot ; Living Dead & quot ; movies . I saw this movie when I was just a small kid and loved it . This is about as Camp 80 's as horror movies get . The movie 's premis is a nice homage to Romero . Apparently , the movie & quot ; Night of the Living Dead & quot ; was based on a true story , and it was covered up by the US government . The bodies of the zombies were sealed in oil drums and dispersed . Two workers at a medical supplies warehouse find one of these drums , puncture it be accident , and unleash a gas that brings the nearby dead back to life . As luck would have it , the warehouse is right next to a graveyard . The rest writes itself , and the movie has some of the funnist moments in horror movie history : A cadaver running amok in the warehouse , a zombie 's head being hit out of the park with a baseball bat , a zombie who orders & quot ; more paramedics & quot ; like he was ordering pizza . And above all , a stylish 80 's hard rock soundtrack . This is one of my favorite party movies , because it get everyone ( even the non-horror fans ) howling . It is sometime bloody , but the comedy overshadows the horror elements . The DVD in question is a bit light on the extras , save for a documentary that is fun , but tepid . But the big perk is the best picture and sound quality I have ever seen this movie in . The DVD really makes a difference . Get yourself a copy and see what I mean , you wo n't regret it .
