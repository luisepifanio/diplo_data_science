As I 'm sure most reviews of clone wars make clear , these are better than the prequel films . More action , less standing around discussing politics and forbidden love , and stories that do n't grind to a halt every 20 minutes.These are amazing . It 's hard to call them cartoons . It will haunt me forever that the attack on Coruscant in vol . 2 was n't in Episode III.These are must haves for any fan .
