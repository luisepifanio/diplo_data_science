Ghost World is a coming-of-age story that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most elusive in modern memory . Enid ( Thora Birch ) is stuck in a small town with peers and adults who are going nowhere . Only Norman , the aging would-be bus passenger , is reliable in her view -- maybe because he is at least trying to leave town -- though this is not something that is thrown at the audience but rather something to think about.This is a thoughtful film with appealing characters , sharp wit and soft warmth . The composition including use of color in set and costume is lush and crisp ; the editing and camera highly expressive . I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to better understand the lives and issues of middle-class young people grappling with the search for identity at the end of the twentieth century .
