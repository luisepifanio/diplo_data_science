`` The Exorcist '' , along with such movies as `` Rosemary 's Baby '' , `` The Shining '' , and `` The Ring '' stand out to me as some of the greatest horror movies of all time . Not only were they great movies in and of themselves , but they `` broke the rules '' and treaded new ground . This DVD contains many deleted scenes and behind the scenes looks at the making of the movie.I know I have heard that after a screening of the movie a few months before it was released , some screen executives thought that the movie should not be released . It was just too scary . When you truly watch the movie for the first time , you will truely be scared ... ... if you take it in deeply enough . Some people remember it for the `` pea soup '' incident , but this movie did n't use gore to make its point . Like the other movies listed above , it used intelligent imagery , dialogue , and symbols to make its points.Most people reading this review know that the story was based on a case in 1947 in which a 13-year old boy was supposed to be possessed . Obviously some details were changed for the movie . I would like to see a movie of the `` true '' story from 1947 made in which no names are reveiled but the facts of the case are given . The Exorcist truly deserves all 5 stars . Maybe more writers and movie makers today ought to go back and watch it before they attempt to make another foolish teen movie that calls itself a horror film .
