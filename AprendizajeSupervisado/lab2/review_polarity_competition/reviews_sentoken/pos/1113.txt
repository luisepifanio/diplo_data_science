I was particularly keen to buy this volume . The Fairytales include `` Arabian Knights '' and `` Robin Hood . `` If you 're an Australian buyer , the Australian DVD box set `` 10 Movies Family Fun '' gives you ten of Rankin Bass 's Festival of Family Classics episodes . I was able to collect VHS copies of the rest ( 2nd hand ) .But these two episodes always eluded me , until this volume came out.And I bought Volumes 1 & 3 as well , for better remastered copies of the episodes on those DVDs.Bernard Cowan 's narration on the beginning theme leads into that lovely song , which is the charm of the series.Relive your own childhood , or buy it for your kids . These are fairytales told in a standard as appealing as Disney .
