I really thought it would be awesome to watch a movie in 3d AND HD ... but unfortunately they havent come up with a way to provide a 3d experience at home without discoloration of the characters . Due to the glasses everything in the picture has a green tint . it kind of defeats the purpose of HD . all that aside , the movie is pretty good ! I havent yet watched the 2d version , so i really cant review that aspect of the disc , but there are some neat 3d effects despite the green people .
