After I spied this series on my local library 's shelves & saw that it was about a female aspiring chef set in 1900-1910 London , I scooped up all the volumes.This series really surprised me : It has strong writing and attention to setting . Louisa Trotter is a outspoken , cockney chef who works her way up in her profession and British society with lots of elbow grease , an understanding of human nature , and some luck . Gemma Jones is great as Louisa Trotter and the supporting cast is very solid as well.I was n't sure at first if this series was a miniseries or a TV series ( It 's TV ) , but it is rather Dickensian in that each episode builds on the previous . And I can pay a series no higher complement than to say that the conflict resolutions are neither trite nor perfunctory . Many allusions to historically accurate events , politicians , and contemporary culture are weaved into the storylines . I feel that I learned more about English classism and social mores from the `` Duchess '' & the Bentinck Hotel than from my semester abroad in London.If you like period drama ( and comedy ) & strong , nuanced heroines with many battles to fight , then you will like `` The Duchess of Duke Street . '' This series stands the test of time . My only complaint is that I did not learn much about the culinary arts , but the writing is so above standard that my complaint is rendered inconsequential.Although this series began filming in 1976 the production values make it difficult to place . The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to BBC 's 1979 Pride and Prejudice .
