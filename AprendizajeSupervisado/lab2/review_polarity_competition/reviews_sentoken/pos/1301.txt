I believe the excellence of Waitress stands on its own , but my desire to like it was no doubt heightened by the post-production tragedy of the murder of writer/director Adrienne Shelly . I think co-star Cheryl Hines says it best in the featurette : Shelly 's tragic and senseless death compels you to watch the movie through a different prism.I was surprised that Keri Russell was n't nominated for any best actress awards . I thought she was outstanding . She 's in every scene . Her performance carries the movie . It 's really a series of interactions between she and husband Earl ( a wonderfully unlikable Jeremy Sisto ) , she and customer/owner Old Joe ( a dyspeptic Andy Griffith ) and she and physician/suitor Dr. Pomatter . In particular , the relationship between Russell 's Jenna and Nathan Fillion 's Pomatter is very well-played , both by the actors themselves and from Shelly 's strong writing and direction . She will be missed .
