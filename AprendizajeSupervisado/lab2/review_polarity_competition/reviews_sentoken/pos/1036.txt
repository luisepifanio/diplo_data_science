I really liked seeing the walk through from basic saw setup to actual applications . I am new to the world of table saws and find the video to be invaluable . I have worked with many saws but just never a table saw and all the stories and horror stories made me nervous . I feel much more confident after watching this video ( on my second time now ) . I would have given it 5 stars but the DVD cracked the first time I took it out of the case - cheap plastic media and a really tight case . I also bought Taunton 's Complete Illustrated Guide to Tablesaws and have found them both very helpful .
