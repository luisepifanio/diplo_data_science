I 'm a soap fan , but even my husband loved it . We then had friends over and insisted on watching it again for us , and for them to see ... did this with several friends . And they all loved it and laughed ! After having worked in the television advertising business for 18 years , I could really relate..Also with the driving in Los Angeles . That dummy sure looked inviting , and even the bum ! Clever Clever Clever ! A must see .
