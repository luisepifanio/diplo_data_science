The 1980 's were not Disney heyday for films . However this devil of a film was cute for the 1980'a.Bill Cosby is a soul Arranger who give a recently dead Max Devlin ( Elliot Gould ) a chance to return to earth . His assignment for two months to get three innocent souls to sell their souls . Cosby as Devil is almost as fun as George Burns was in Oh God You Devil . I will say this , when Cos is on screen , he steals the scene away from Gold everytime.On the other hand , Gould plays a slick con man who is not the sharpest tool in the box . His wide-eyes deer in the headlights look makes his heroic Devlin like most Disney main characters . Gould 's simple Devlin does not try to be heroic , it comes out at the endAs flawed and as dated as this film is ( its almost 27 years old ) , it still holds up as a family film.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLDThis cute comedy does not sound preachy . It is Disney with a slight edge . It is a nice family film , it seems dated , but still its good .
