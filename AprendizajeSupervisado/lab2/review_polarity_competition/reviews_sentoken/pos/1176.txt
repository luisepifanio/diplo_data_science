1 . Hope ... I hope you will buy this dvd . One of the best opera that I have seen on DVD.2 . Blood ... This cast has passion . Levine is divine . Domingo is a strong Calaf with a dramatic voice that soars over Puccini 's masterpiece . His acting is tremendous as usuall . Mitchell is the bonus of this great cast . She sings flawlessly and one of the best Liu I have heard.3 . Turandot ... Eva Marton might not be the best Turandot , but that does not matter . When she and Domingo were singing in act III it was magic . When she was shedding tears while singing my heart palpitated to a renewed passion of why I loved Opera to begin with . My eyes and ears where glued to my home theater . For all I care Marton and Domingo could have cracked their voices and it would have not mattered to me a bit , cause folks the stars were alligned right over the Met that night . I have not seen Metha 's version of the Turandot , but this is the best Turandot I have seen so far .
