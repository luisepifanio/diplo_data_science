Great movie . . . good actors . . . love the European feel to the movie and Matt Damon actually comes across as sexy . I really enjoyed the movie , although I had a real dislike for the book when I tried reading it after having seen the movie.It 's probably best not to try to compare the two . They 're just too different .
