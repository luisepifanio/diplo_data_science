My three year old was having a very difficult time using the potty until we purchased this DVD . She was stubborn and would refuse to use the potty , then she would intentionally have `` accidents '' throughout the day and night . I was thoroughly frustrated and just about to `` lose '' it . From the moment we first watched this DVD , she turned a corner . This DVD really struck a chord with her . She wanted to be a big kid . She wanted to use the potty and she wanted to wear `` big kid underwear '' . I was singing `` Hallelujah '' praises to this DVD . Since we purchased this DVD , she has only had 3 accidents in about 3 months . Although , we still have to remind her to use the potty , she is using the potty consistently.And , to my surprise there was an added benefit from watching this DVD as a family ... my 20 month old began wanting to use the potty also . He was n't even 18 months old and he was insisting on sitting on the potty and using it . So , I am saving money on his diapers now too . He does not have success every time , but he is on his way to toilet success too . He proudly wears his `` big kid '' underpants over his diaper , but he would not have it any other way . He loves his underwear ! This DVD has been a lifesaver and truly it has been my salvation .
