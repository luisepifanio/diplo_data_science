I have to say I am very pleased with the reboot of the series . I am a little say that it is on the chopping block for cancellation.The voice work is superb , as is the art style . As I grew up with the original show that I swear was voiced by 3 people it is fantastic that they have a full staff of voice artists doing the characters ( If you have heard the original screeching voices you will understand ) . The artwork is top notch clean animations and easy to follow during action scenes . Good story as well very deep considering the audience it was intended for.all in all a great buy in my opinion .
