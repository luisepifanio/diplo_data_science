I 'll be brief and to the point.This dvd remastering is fantastic . You can see the pores in his skin , the follicles of his hair . The sound is beautiful . We have all already seen the concert , but not like this . Thank you , thank you , thank you goes out to all the people who painstakingly beautified this dvd to its peak visual and aural symphony.Well done and enjoy it !
