You will not regret it ! If I had known how entertaining and clever this movie was , I would have taken my son to see it when it was in the theater . I am pretty tired of the & quot ; Disney Formula & quot ; and this animated movie has revitalized my expectations for the company . The voices are a riot from the fabulous Eartha Kitt as a hilarious villaness to her brawny sidekick Kronk ( Patrtick & quot ; Putty & quot ; Warburton ) to the condescending but humorous Spade . Disney casts aside sappy sentimentality in this flick to emphasize humor and wit . A great example is the portrayal of Pacha 's pregnant wife at home alone with two young children who cleverly uses her kids to thwart the antagonists . Surprising and extremely funny . As trite as it may sound , this film & quot ; works on many levels & quot ; providing clever humor for adults with great visuals and jokes for kids . And the theme of kindness and selflessness is done with uncharacterisitcally subtleness without losing the message.For the price of rentals these days , the cost of owning the movie is not that much more , especially given the number of times we view it . I am extremely pleased with my purchase and glad I looked past a premise that seemed absurd to enjoy one of the most creative films to come from Disney in a long time .
