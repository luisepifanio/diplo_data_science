Well , any Monty Python tape is a classic . This set is no exception . I have also purchased from Amazon the scripts for the Python episodes . The set contains some favourite sketches like the & quot ; architect 's sketch ' and the 'Ministry of silly walks'.This does not mean that out of the three tapes only two sketches are worth mentioning . On the contrary . The set guarantees 3 hours of 'silly laughs ' -as the Pythons would put it- and-what 's also important- at a good price .
