I am a senior citizen with bad knees from injuries . I can do almost all of these exercises and hope that with time , I 'll be able to do them all though I do n't know if I 'll ever be able to do things that puts pressure on my kneecaps . I 'm modifying those that are too much at this point . It 's easy to fit these strengthening exercises into my early morning schedule without a lot of fuss . And boy can I see the results .
