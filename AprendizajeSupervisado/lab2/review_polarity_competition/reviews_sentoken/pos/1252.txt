... well , then frankly , that 's a real tragedy . But if you do , then THIS IS IT ! This is still my favorite black & white classic film of all time ( followed very , very closely by CITIZEN KANE . Hey , I had to chose one , right ? ) ! This film is the whole reason I got a DVD player in the first place . Nothing looks as beautiful and as crisp as classic b & w cinema . This was the first DVD I ever bought ! Like a Honda automobile , this film speaks for itself , so I wo n't waste time with a rehash of every praised word that could be said . Let me say only that when the AFI recently did their list of the top 100 greatest movie lines of all time , CASABLANCA was chosen the most ( 6 times ) .Here 's lookin ' at you !
