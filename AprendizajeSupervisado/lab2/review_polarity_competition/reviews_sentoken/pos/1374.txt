Adam Sandler turns in a great performance in this follow up to `` Magnolia '' from director Paul Thomas Anderson . Emily Watson is equally good . Adam plays Barry Egan , a man with seven sisters who feels neglected , depressed , and unloved ... until he crosses paths with one of his sister 's good friends . Gradually , they develop a relationship and start dating . Meanwhile , Barry is going through a dilemma with a ring of phone sex operators . All of this leads to a beautiful finale in the best film that I have seen all year.I will own this DVD . I highly recommend this movie !
