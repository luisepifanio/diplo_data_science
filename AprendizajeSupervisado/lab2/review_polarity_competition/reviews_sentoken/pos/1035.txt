this dvd is such a treasure , particularly if like me , you 've seen the band live and just ca n't get enough of them . it 's a lot of fun to watch these live performances and also get to meet the band , and catch them in their tired , drunken , rockin , kiddin around , states . the dvd also deals with the issue of am ! being asked by universal to sign a record deal with them , but am ! has stayed loyal to Fat Wreck and aint going to be a part of the corporate machine . much respect to them for that decision . ( if you go to a show of theirs , say hi to the band , they 're so friendly and you can probably get to talk to them there = ) the energy of this band is captured on this dvd and i am so greatful to them for making this dvd and all their many albums.im not sure exactly what else i should write for this review ! against me ! is one of the most rockin bands and i am so thankful that they put their political views out there unabashedly ! right on ! few bands have such great politics and spirited , passionate , thoughtful , loud and rockin music . thank you , am ! the only downside with this DVD is that it makes you miss them.so support the independent music out there , that is a part of the revolution !
