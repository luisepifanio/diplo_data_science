My favorite television series of all time , but I 'll leave it to others to evaluate its artistic merit . I just wanted to comment that I have had no problems at all with picture quality or any technical issues with this product , as has been mentioned in some of the reviews . So , if you like unusual , witty , often corny , eccentric humor , with a little mild adventure and romance thrown in and a definite Canadian twist , you should check this out . If you already know the show and love it , I would say : put your fears aside and buy this product right now while you can still get it .
