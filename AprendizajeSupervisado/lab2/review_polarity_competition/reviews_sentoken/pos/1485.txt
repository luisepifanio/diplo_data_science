Far from the usual corny vision of many war films of the time , TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH deserves it 's reputation.You do n't have here twelve bombings every fifteen minutes just to create action for action sake.What you have is a realistic war story dealing with men who risks their life and become obsessed with the fear of not coming back.GREGORY PECK gives a great performance , strong and also vulnerable in the end.Considering that this film was made in 1949 , it 's certainly a classic.If you love war films with a lot of action , a girl ornementation and a HOLLYWOOD vision , do n't see this movie , it 's simply beyond you .
