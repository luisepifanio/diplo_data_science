You all know the movie , one of the all-time greats . This is a review of the Blu-Ray from the UK . First , it 's region free so it will play on US machines . Second , the picture is absolutely GORGEOUS ; crisp , clear , and vibrant ! Third , the sound seems pretty good but I do n't have a sophisticated home entertainment system so I ca n't give you much info there . This is a great transfer and is like seeing the movie for the first time !
