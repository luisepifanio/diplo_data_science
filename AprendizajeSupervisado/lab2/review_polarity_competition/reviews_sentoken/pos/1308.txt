Minority Report - This movie got a bad reputation , but its creativity and moral questions are what keep the movie interesting . pretty soon maybe we will all be wearing numbers so the government can track you ! ! Spielberg , although not the greatest director or movie maker , does a better job at dropping subtle kubrick style hints questioning the world we live in . Tom Cruise is a good actor and the others were good too but the moral questioning is the movie . I like it .
