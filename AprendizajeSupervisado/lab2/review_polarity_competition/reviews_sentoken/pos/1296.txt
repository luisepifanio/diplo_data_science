I first learned about Leslie 's work outs through an ON Demand 10 minute workout that was on my cable program . I did it for a few days and loved it ! I have been doing this 1 & 2 mile walk for the past few days and I am sore ( which is a great thing ) . I even had my boyfriend to try it one day and he was sweating like crazy and said that his abs have never been that sore ! I love this DVD ! I havent had a chance to look at the 3 mile DVD that came along with it yet , but I am sure its just as great.At times Leslie does get a little carried away with the talking , and interacting with Jimmy . But after a few workouts you will ignore it . But there is an option on the DVD where u can have the whole workout where the its only music and you can not hear her talking , If the talking is distracting you too much .
