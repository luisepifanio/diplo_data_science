Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD 's you will ever see . It is done with class and a great respect for the talent . Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer . Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today . the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on & quot ; Two Kinds of People In The World & quot ; is worth the price alone . I have played this piece over and over . All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through .
