My son loves this DVD . He would watch it every day ( or more ) if we would let him . We tried other DVDs and most were really hooky . This one is n't . Although the cinematography is n't professional , that only bothers some reviewers . My son could care less . He is fascinated ! We love driving down the street and naming all the trucks we learned in the video . My son is 2 now and has been watching this video for at least 6 months . He asks for it by name . I just bought 4 more copies for his friends .
