Scarlet Street is better than The Woman in the Window . The nightmare vision is darker , more grotesquely detailed , more mean-spirited . And it does n't have a compromised ending as does Woman.Lang focuses his attention on every hideous little detail of quiet desperation that compels the characters to their tragic and inevitable fates . Thus , Robinson , a humble small-time bookkeeper ( who paints lurid streetscapes in the kitchen ( after he 's done the dinner dishes ) is trapped in a claustrophobic marriage to a hulking harriden who thinks art is a waste of time and money . He dreams of an escape through his art and the deceptively dishy Bennett . Bennett and her fancy man , Duryea , both scheming sociopaths , have a very different set of dreams . Everyone loses .
