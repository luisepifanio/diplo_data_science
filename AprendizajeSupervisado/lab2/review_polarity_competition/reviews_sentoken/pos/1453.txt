I was waiting so long to get this movie remastered on dvd.Here it is . Danny Kaye is a so various talented singer and actor and this movie is brilliant for him.The court jester is also a very good and a must see for all who liked Merry Andrew.I 'm a big circus fan and also a circus artist , this movie shows what a real circus is about.Not a circus factory like today , no it 's a family tradition . Colourful and Funny !
