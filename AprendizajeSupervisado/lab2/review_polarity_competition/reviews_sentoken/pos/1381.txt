Well , if you have n't seen this you are in for something great . This is one of the funniest movies ever made -- certainly abbot and costello 's best , and that 's no small thing . But it also has Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. both in the roles that made them famous and both playing it totally straight -- which is one of the things that makes it such a classic . This is the original classic that has inspired HUNDREDS of imitations , from the Bowery Boys all the way to scooby-doo . This is horror/comedy at its pinnacle -- it ca n't be done better . It 's a fact that legendary rock guitarist jerry garcia considered this his all-time favorite movie ( seriously ) and for very good reason . For atmosphere , classic movie monsters , and hilarity this movie is the best ever . it actually deserves six stars but you can only give five . It 's the Casablanca of horror/comedy . Often imitated , never duplicated .
