I have done a few beginner pilates videos trying to find a few good ones because I like variety in my workouts . I did not like this video at all because the workout has been prerecorded and then the instructor does a voice over of what she is doing and what you are supposed to be doing . She goes WAY too fast for a beginner and keeps saying `` exhale , exhale , exhale '' but when are you supposed to inhale ? Because she is not actually instructing as she goes through the workout she does not give you enough time or instruction about what is coming up next . She will be explaining exactly what she is doing and just as you are figuring it out she switches again . Also , sometimes they zoom in on the face of the person who is doing a modified exercise . This is pointless because when you are trying to look at the bodies of the person to imitate their form all you see is their face ! I would not recommend this for anyone . Try something else . For a beginner this video was very poorly done .
