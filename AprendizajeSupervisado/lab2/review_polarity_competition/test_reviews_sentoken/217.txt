We rented this out of our love for the Treasure Island story as well as our respect for Jack Palance 's acting skills . While Mr. Palance performed well , the story itself was totally twisted . The `` good guys '' became the `` bad guys '' and the `` bad guys '' turned out to be actually the `` good guys '' . Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about ( and yes , I have read the original story ) . SPOILER : the story ends by the `` hero '' Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn ( the `` good guys '' of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their `` just reward '' in death ! ) . The only reason I rated this a `` 1-star '' was because there was not a `` zero-star '' rating .
