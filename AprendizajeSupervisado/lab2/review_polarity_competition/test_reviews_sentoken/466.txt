I have been a fan of Tom Cruise 's older films for the longest time , so regardless of his disappointing performance in War of the Worlds , I decided I was n't going to give up on him yet . And I must say in this film that his acting is indeed less embarrassing but also pretty average . He does n't impress I mean , I think many actors could have did his role easily and just as well unforunately . The rest of the cast was pretty average too ... I do n't know they failed to keep the story interesting all of them.That was n't the only problem either . The biggest to me was the action . I do n't know but throughout the entire movie I grew very tired of all the ways the movie was trying to impress me with the very heavy action scenes . I think it all was a bit much after awhile , and unnecessary even in some parts of the film . I think Tom Cruise needs to learn a little does a lot . That 's my view on it . Some others may just love all of that but I did n't . Those sort of scenes ended up leaving me very bored and even fast forwarding in some parts.The entire movie lost me quickly . I stayed till the end , but I was glad when the credits finally rolled . Compared to War of the Worlds this movie is a step up for Cruise , but that is n't saying too much honestly.2/5
