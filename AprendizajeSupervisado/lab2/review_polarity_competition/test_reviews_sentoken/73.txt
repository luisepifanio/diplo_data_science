This is one of those rare and great Disney treats that is a family edition must have ! All those familiar with the original Wonderful World of Disney TV series will be familiar with this short movie ( remember originally made for the one hour TV program ) and it looks and sounds brilliant.Certainly a great look into a bit of history as to what we did with our leisure time in those days and along with the escapades of two playful bear cubs and their mother not far behind , this is just a great and enjoyable outing all the way and sure to get you laughing and wishing for those days again .
