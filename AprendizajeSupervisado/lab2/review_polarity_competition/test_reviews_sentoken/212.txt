I was n't sure what to expect when I saw `` The Bourne Identity . '' Having never read the book or seen the TV miniseries , I knew little about the premise . In addition , I was n't sure how well Matt Damon would do playing an action hero.What I saw was an excellent movie with a great cast and terrific acting.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , an amnesiac who knows his name only because it was on a passport he found with his picture on it . He does n't know where he has been , where he lives , or what he does for a living . The only thing he knows is that he found a safety deposit box that belongs to him with tens of thousands of dollars of money , several more passports , and a gun . Oh yeah ... . and people keep trying to kill him.Although the movie starts a little on the slow side ( which was necessary to set up the premise ) , once it gets started it keeps going with barely a chance to catch your breath.Another reason to like this movie : the director did not mess it up by inserting a pointless and unneeded love sequence . Yes , you know the two main characters will get together at some point . However , once we see that they are going to get together , we do n't see them going at it . No scenes of them falling into bed together , and no scenes of them waking up together the next morning . More movies need to comprehend the idea of less is more.This DVD Collector 's Edition also contains several great extras . One of my favorites is the alternate ending which was apparently filmed and then , wisely , scrapped . In addition , you can view four deleted scenes which had been , also wisely , scrapped , and an extended farmhouse scene . There is also a `` Making Of '' commentary in this section.If you are a Matt Damon or an action fan , this is one movie that you are going to want to see .
