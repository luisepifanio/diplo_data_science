Hey , I know it 's no Jurassic Park , but it was 1960 , what do you expect ? This movie has a LOT to offer , pretty cool dinosaurs by that day 's standard ( at least they are n't lizards or crocs with fins glued on them ! ) , and it also has another important element : comedy . The Caveman is simply there for comic relief , and he fills those shoes ( or should I say furry little slippers ) nicely . And do n't forget all the typecast characters : the beautiful blonde femme fetale , the handsome dark haired hero , his forgetable dark haired buddy , the little goofy kid , the fat man , the drunk Irish guy ( dinofood ... ) , and do n't forget the evil guy and his two stupid flunkies . Drop them on a Carribean Isle with a bunch of `` natives '' /extras and a pair of dinos and a caveman , stir , and serve . Get the picture ? But hey , it works . I saw this on TV as a child , stayed up all night to watch it on Horror Incorporated ( the Twin Cities Saturday nite midnight movie show ) , and the DVD version blows the TV versions away . For a 1960 movie , the picture is great , and the sound is n't too bad . Plus it 's enhanced for widescreen TVs ! What else do you want ? It has a trailer and stills too ! GET THIS MOVIE ! And then put it next to Jurassic Park on your shelf , you 'll be glad you did !
