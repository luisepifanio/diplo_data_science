1 ) If you want to see a creature loose in a museum rent Relic . Whatever your thoughts about Relic it was 100 times better than the first 30 minutes of this movie2 ) I really like Christian Slater but I really hope he does n't take any further low budget B horror movie jobs and ruin what career he has3 ) Tara Reid can not act ! ! Either that or the director and/or script was so lame that it made her look bad.4 ) I think what topped it for me was this attractive woman with her baseball hat on backwards ( whats up with that ? ! ) and makeup all done up and she is the comms specialist for some secret government agency ( no dress code ? ) . She just keeps looking pretty and trying to look tough while pushing buttons and giving updates to the Stephen Dorff when he can see for himself what is going on . Really Dumb ! ! 5 ) The director can not create a suspensful scene for the life of him . They relied too heavily on special effects and less on finding a better director.Overall : Not worth even renting . Even if you are a Slater/Reid/Dorff fan do n't do it ! !
