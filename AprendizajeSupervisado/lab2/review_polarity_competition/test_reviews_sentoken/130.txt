Clint Eastwood and Bert Reynolds star in this light hearted spoof of the hard nosed private eye and cop movies.Reynolds is the smart a $ $ private eye and Eastwood is the hard as nails cop in this romp into the 1930s as they battle bootleggers , gangsters , and each other . Eastwood often plays straight man to Reynolds wisecracking character.There are many gags and laughs in the film , but it ` s what I call a soft spoof . It ` s not a wild crazy spoof like `` Airplane '' , It ` smore along the lines of the western spoof `` My Name is Nobody '' . Rather than go for wild crazy gags , they exaggerate the tough guymovie just enough to make it funny . And it works well .
