Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is certainly a classic by any standard . Gene Wilder is simply hilarious and fits the role of Willy Wonka perfectly . I 've seen this movie probably a 100 times already and it never gets old . The movie is perfect for kids as there 's no harsh language or violence ; not to mention adults will love it too ! I give this classic 5 stars ( the songs will be stuck in your head for days ! ) .
