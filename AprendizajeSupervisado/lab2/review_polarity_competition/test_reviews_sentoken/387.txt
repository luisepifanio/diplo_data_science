We live in California and bought a Magnovox Blu-Ray player about 3 years ago . This player has played all our fifty Blu-Ray discs without a hitch until we received the `` Civilization '' disc . We can can hear the audio but there is none of the program video . The box does not appear to have a country or region code . It does have the number `` 2 '' above the word `` Entertain '' on several sides of the box . It may need a player capable of playing region B formatting . Another reviewer reported that it works on some more up-to-date players .
