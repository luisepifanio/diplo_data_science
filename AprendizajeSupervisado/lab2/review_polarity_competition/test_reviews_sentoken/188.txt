I am new to yoga and I thought that this was good for beginners . Of course I was not able to move as much as Ms. Deason but I know that it will take some time to be just as good . I felt very relaxed at the end of the tape and I have noticed that I am more flexable . Some of the camera angles were not all that great . Sometimes her back was toward the camera so you really do n't get to see the move correctly and that 's the only flaw . The modifications at the end were also very helpful , for a beginner .
