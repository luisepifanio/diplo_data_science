I love airplane disaster films , even one as `` bad '' as the TV-movie `` Horror at 37,000 Feet , '' but `` Air Marshal '' is embarrassing ! It is so badly written , badly acted , and badly made , this airplane disaster movie is a DISASTER unto itself . The prologue made no sense and you could n't even connect it to the rest of the movie . The model used for the shots of the plane in flight is so blatantly obvious to be a model , even down to the white-painted centers of the wheels on the landing gear , and it did not look like it was flying , but computer-pasted on a bland sky background . It 's the kind of thing cinema students would make for their cinema class . What really killed it for me were ( 1 ) the plane rolling smoothly on the rough terrain of grass without the landing gear buckling , ( 2 ) for the kid ( a ) to remain unaffected by witnessing the terrorist slit the pilot 's throat , and ( b ) to know how to lower the landing gear , and ( 3 ) for the flight attendant to say and do nothing regarding the kid while all that was going on . So , unless you 're studying bad movies , include it in a `` bad movie '' festival or marathon , or thinking of giving it to the crew of MST3K to watch and make comments , avoid this movie at ALL COSTS ! However , if the story intrigues you , then the best movie to watch is `` Executive Decision '' with Kurt Russell or `` Air Force One '' with Harrison Ford . Actually , I think someone here saw `` Executive Decision , '' and thought to himself , `` I can make that kind of a movie . ''
