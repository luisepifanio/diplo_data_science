I put this on my tv when I had guests over for Memorial Day since my outside music speakers did not work . When guests came into the house they were mesmerized by the DVD and stopped many times to just look and comment . I use this instead of the music channel on my cable when friends come over and we sit and play games and they love to look at it and comment . A great DVD .
