I first saw this as a young boy , spending his pocket money on films . Somehow , the feeling of bravery and manly quality stayed with me . I do not know how I have not seen it in nearly 40 years . I must be one of the few . However I have just bought and watched the DVD version . The feelings came flooding back . Natal was once more a real - and beautiful - country in front of me . The young Michael Caine was again both young - and expressive - clearly destined for stardom . I have since read the true story , and whilst not quite the story shown on film , the film nevertheless gives the feeling of heroism that those Welsh soldiers clearly diplayed that day at Rourke 's Drift . I am not an accomplished critic of films . I simply enjoyed the film immensely .
