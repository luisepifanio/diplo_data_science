Love the meaning behind the movie . The main actress played her part well but others needed more talent . It 's odd how some scenes were spellbindingly professional and then suddenly , it was low quality acting . Would I watch this again ? Not really , unless I 'm super bored and have nothing to watch ... maybe . Scenes were too drawn out . Many scenes were cut and pasted from the original Jesus movie , which made it less like a `` new '' movie .
