This is a thoroughly enjoyable , if not completely beleivable , movie - but then who said movies were supposed to be completely beleivable ? What was believable were the performances of the actors involved . Timothy Hutton was perfect as the sensible yet fiercly principled and devoted leader of a group of boys at a military school , and Tom Cruise dynamite as the head of the Red Berets . Keep in mind George C. Scott , the general , when he mentions to the newly appointed Timothy Hutton how war brings out the `` wolf '' , a kind of primal elation that a man realizes only in warfare . And many other things which help build a logic for what follows in the movie.I was kind of in awe of it the first time I saw it some 26 years ago in a movie theater as an eleven-year-old kid . I saw it again tonight on dvd then just to test my childhood powers of perception , to see if it was as cool as i remembered it , and it pretty much was ! Two thumbs up , Ebert !
