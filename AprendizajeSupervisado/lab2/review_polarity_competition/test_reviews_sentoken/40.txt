Delectably fantastic is the way I would describe Pixar 's RATATOUILLE ; just the perfect blend of ingredients to make an informative film on the art of cooking that is both savoury and sweet for adults and enough action and cuteness for the kids ( kids that do not get bored easily and have a bit of `` je ne sais quoi '' that is either inborn or taught by some diligent and progressive parents ! ) .Having run a dining facility for nine years now , I found that RATATOUILLE served up a deliciously adult entree of informative cooking tips and cooking terms that we teach at our restaurant.The information about how a kitchen is run and the personel hierarchy is spot-on.We try to always create `` the new '' knowing that the patrons and the critics are always `` on the prowl '' to catch us on an off day ! So , I had NO problems at all with the total enjoyability of this very clever film.I found it far more illuminating than EMERIL and JULIA CHILDS ! The fact that a rat named Remy ( named after Remy Martin I presume ) is the chief-artiste made this rollicking good film all the more delightful.The French accents , the cooking terms , the problem with patrons and critics are all very adult themes , and I saw children around me squirming and laughing occasionally.The adults , though , roared and had a good time and I wondered , '' Did Pixar just trick we adults into seeing a film aimed primarily at us ? '' Well , if they did then it worked for me.I loved every last bite , every last morsel and I belched with approval after the dessert !
