I got a DVD player last week and Joshua Tree was one my top ten movies to get . Then I discover that Artisan have released it in fullscreen and not even in the proper title . Jeez , was I upset and deeply crestfallen.This is an outrageous action movie that very deserved a better release than it got . The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack may be better than the VHS but the musical score ( awesome ) sounds terrible and even & quot ; chewed up & quot ; in places . The fullscreen picture is even grainy and has too much color shimmer.All us fans can do is hope that the ever falling retail price of this DVD means is that Artisan is planning to do a proper widescreen release sometime in the future .
