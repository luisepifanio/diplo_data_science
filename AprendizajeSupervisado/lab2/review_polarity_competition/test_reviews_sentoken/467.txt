I am a lover of The Firm . I have had fantastic results with their videos , but this one I find very disappointing . I did not feel worked out afterward . It is broken up into 3 sections working the upper body , lower body and abs separately . It does not have the advantage of the other Firm videos that do more in less time by working the lower body along with the upper body . After each section , I thought & quot ; Is that it ? ! & quot ; However , if you are really short on time or just beginning , this workout may be great for you . It is extremely beginner friendly and can be easily used in 15 minute sections . If you want a wonderfully intense workout and can exercise for a full hour , try & quot ; The Firm Body Sculpting Basics & quot ; . Another great one that takes only 45 minutes is & quot ; The Firm Maximum Body Shaping & quot ; .
