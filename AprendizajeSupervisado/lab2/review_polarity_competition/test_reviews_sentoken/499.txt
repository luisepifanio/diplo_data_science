Do yourself a favor and do not buy this DVD ! This movie has been recut horribly ! the edits make the movie move faster in a clumsy sloppy way . There was no need to re-edit the original , which was a fantastic movie ! One of my personal favorites.I hope there will be enough bad reviews of this DVD to prompt a re-release of ETV in it 's original format . Truely a bad idea on the part of Terry Jones .
