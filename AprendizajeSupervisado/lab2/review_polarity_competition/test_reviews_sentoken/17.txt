This is the first time I 've run into a to-DVD transfer that is so horrible that I feel I need to add to the reviews . If it was n't for the movie , it 'd get 0 stars . Aspect ratio is off ( thank you PowerDVD for allowing me to fix that ) , sound level is low ( need to turn volume up to max ) and sound quality not much better . Picture quality fairly fuzzy . Do n't waste your money .
