... .Marlon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison will make you laugh over and over again.After a star college basketball player dies of a heart condition , his little brother must take the team leader role . The older brother comes back as a ghost ( that only his brother can see ) to lead the team to be one of the best in the nation . They pull off some great tricks on the other teams like making a opposing player who picks on his little brother shoot a free throw like a quarterback throws a pass . The 6th Man is an excellent comedy for anyone , especially teens .
