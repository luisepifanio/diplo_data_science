I mistakenly received two versions of Season 2 and both have serious defects in the v. same places . On the first disk of each version , Episode 3 can not be watched because of serious pixeling which turns the image into a mosaic really , and extremely garbled sound . Episode 4 lacks any form of intro and when an image finally does appear , one is well into the story . On the duplicate copy there 's a message on disk 3 that it can not not be played . I found a # for Amazon , finally , and will try to speak w/a person about their poor quality control for this series . Needless to say , I 'll hold off reordering any more copies of this series.I have Season 1 , and I think the entire series is being done on the cheap frankly . The packaging itself is rather poor and , as any owner knows , they squeezed an entire season using both sides of a single disk . The disks themselves have no images imprinted them ; they look like something one could buy by the dozen from any office supply store . I was quite startled when I opened it frankly.Any other folks share my experience and disappointment ?
