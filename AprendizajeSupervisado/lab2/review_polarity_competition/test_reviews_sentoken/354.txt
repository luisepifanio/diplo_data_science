This movie is awful.The movie took some of the most talented young actors in Hollywood and wasted their talents in this dreadful teen romance.The movie is about a private school prep that crashes into a diner and has to spend his summer re-building it.While he is re-building this diner he falls for LeeLee Sobieski , who is dating Josh Hartnet.Yeah rich prep and poor sick smalltown girl fall for each other and she dumps Josh ( why ? why ? ) for this rich prep.Oh and she is dying as well.This movie is horrid.Chris Klien , LeeLee Sobieski , and Josh Hartnet wasted their talent for this awful movie.The movie is so predictable it 's just not even funny.Do n't even waste your time.If you want a good drama get A Walk To Remember .
