I knew this movie stunk ... but I mean ... it really DOES stink ! The word & quot ; leverage & quot ; is repeated over and over , it 's like the director wanted to hypnotize his crowd with subliminal messages . The past reviewer said it all ... & quot ; It 's like riding horses & quot ; , read that one too.This movie is riduculous , I 'm a SFX designer and I felt insulted with the mokery made towards Sci-Fi films along this one.My advice avoid this one ... no ... scartch that ... rent it and watch HOW messed up can a movie actually be.Buah haa haa haaa haa !
