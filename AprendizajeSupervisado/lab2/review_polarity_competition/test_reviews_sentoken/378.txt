This tape was given to me by a mother of a child in my daughter 's dance class . Learning she did yoga and noticing she looked phenomenal while chasing 3 children aged 5 and younger just like I was , I asked her for her opinion on yoga for a beginner and this is the tape she gave me . ( Giving videos to the interested is now my `` philanthropy '' in her honor ! ) It took a little while for me to even try it , but when I did , I was completely blown away by yoga and have done it almost every day since Feb 1 , 2006 because it feels so good ! To me it is like a massage from the inside out . As a mother with 3 small children , I really appreciated the slow , and should I call it , sensual movements , that require surprising strength . For me with my young kids , I think I relished the thought of having the TIME to do such slow and sensual poses , but I have learned to fit it in . From this video , I got good solid instruction on basic yoga and learned how yoga enhances my life instead of being yet another obligation . I have since purchased many new videos and do yoga every day and feel like I have found the ultimate mind/body answer for the rest of my life . And by the way , I did n't even know I was searching for a `` mind/body '' answer until discovering yoga . Yoga is really good stuff and this video is an ideal place to begin !
