I like `` creature '' flicks - even the bad ones - so had high hopes this movie would be at least entertaining . It was n't . Much of the movie makes no sense ( the creature can read minds and yet apparently ca n't ? ) and the rest of it was just a jumble of weird bizarre images that did n't gel . Do yourself a favor - watch Lake Placid and pass on this one .
