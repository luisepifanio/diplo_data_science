I first saw & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; about 3 years ago when it hit video , and thought it was a good if not great effort by famed weirdo director David Lynch . On the whole , I enjoyed the warped logic of the story , the eclectic cast of characters , and the sudden conclusion . On the techincal end , I thought the picture ( presented in full-screen format ) was fuzzy and murky , and often distracted from the film ; that , and the soundtrack ( with contributions from Angelo Badalamenti and Trent Reznor ) felt underused.Well , recently I purchased the letterboxed version of & quot ; Lost Highway , & quot ; and was amazed at how much better the movie seemed watching through that squashed rectangle of screen . The picture actually seemed to be remastered a bit from the original video print ( the fuzziness is mostly gone ) , and for some reason the movie did n't flow as clunkily as it had the other times I viewed it.Lynch is an undeniably talented director , but if you rent ( or buy ) & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; based upon his reputation alone , you might be disappointed . The dream-like story ( about a jazz saxophonist who may or may not have killed his wife , is put in prison , and mysteriously morphs into a young mechanic with mob links ) lacks the smooth flow of events that was present in Lynch 's excellent & quot ; Blue Velvet. & quot ; What 's most distracting are the meaningless , drawn-out sex scenes that seem to come one after another in the second act ; either Lynch really loved seeing Patricia Arquette naked , or he wanted to see how far he could push the movie 's R rating.All in all , & quot ; Lost Highway & quot ; -- even with its noticeable flaws -- is better than most of the films mainstream Hollywood puts out . Even if you do n't like it , it will be hard not to claim this film is a good conversation piece .
