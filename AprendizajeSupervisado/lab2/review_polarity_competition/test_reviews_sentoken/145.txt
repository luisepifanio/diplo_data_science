Note that the below reviews of this disc are for the complete , 15-chapter serial FLASH GORDON 'S TRIP TO MARS . This disc , however , is an edited & quot ; feature & quot ; version and is a poor replacement for the full serial , available from Image Entertainment ( along with the other two FLASH GORDON serials ) in a beautifully restored edition . Get that and skip this .
