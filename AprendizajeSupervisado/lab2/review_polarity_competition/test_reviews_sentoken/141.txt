Carnivale is a TV show that seemingly came out of nowhere and debuted on HBO in 2003 . It depicts the struggle between good and evil , light vs. darkness and how they are forever intertwined . This battle takes place during the Depression with its focus on the inner workings of a traveling carnival.Disc One features an audio commentary on `` Milfay '' by director Rodrigo Garcia , series creator Daniel Knauf and executive producer Howard Klein . This is a very informative track with all the participants making some good observations.There is also an audio commentary on `` After the Ball is Over '' by director Jeremy Podeswa , Klein and Knauf . They talk about the casting of certain characters with people who looked like they came from that time period.Disc Five features an audio commentary on `` Hot and Bothered '' by Podeswa , Klein and Knauf . They talk about the look of the show . One quickly gets the feeling that they started running out of things to say by this track judging by the lengthy lulls between comments.The final disc has a Making Of featurette . Knauf felt that the inner workings of a carnival had never been dramatized before . The cast and crew talk about their characters and the themes of the show.Ultimately , Carnivale poses a lot of questions . How did Ben and Justin get their powers and why them ? How does Ben 's fevered dreams of a man fighting in the bloody , dirty trenches of World War I figure in his past and that of the mysterious owner of the carnival whom we never see ( and might not even be human ) ? By the end of the season there are precious few answers but some tantalizing clues that will hopefully be explored in more detail in the upcoming season .
