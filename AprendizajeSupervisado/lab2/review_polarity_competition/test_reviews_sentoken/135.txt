Sorry but the quality of this DVD was HORRIBLE . I returned it after viewing 2 minutes . I love DVDs for the quality of the picture and this has tons of movie projector black marks -- you know the marks you get watching an old 16mm film . Someone took an old 16mm film and simply recorded onto DVD , much like some of those cheap Paramount DVDs ( Bram Stoker 's Dracula comes to mind ) . Digitally remaster this and maybe I 'll be impressed .
