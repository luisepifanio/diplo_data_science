The film presents several nude men swimming through a set meant to resemble ruins of Atlantis . The lighting is murky in the extreme , making it difficult to enjoy the one thing `` Boyfish '' has to offer , the beautiful bodies of the swimming men . Nothing happens onscreen beyond the swimmers crossing the screen from time to time . It is animated wallpaper for your television . Erotic ? I do n't think so .
