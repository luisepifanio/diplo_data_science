With it 's great soundtrack by John Cafferty , and great acting by Michael Pare ' as Eddie and a young Ellen Barkin as a reporter investigating Eddie 's disappearance and assumed death in the mid 1960s , this movie is one of the greatest rock themed movies ever . Eddie is the leader of a rock band which for it 's time is cutting edge . In 1963 , Eddie & amp ; the Cruisers work on an album that is light years ahead of anything they or anyone else had ever done . Through Barkin 's interviews with the band members and others who knew Eddie , we discover the perfectionist Eddie was , his commitment to the project of releasing his new album and how he dealt with critical reaction to that album . A great song from the soundtrack is & quot ; On the Dark Side , & quot ; a rocker with a Neil Diamond & quot ; Cherry Cherry & quot ; chord progression . I love both the movie and it 's soundtrack . I highly recommend Eddie & amp ; the Cruisers .
