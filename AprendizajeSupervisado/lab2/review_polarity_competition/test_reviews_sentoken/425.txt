Ethan Hawke actually shows his acting chops in this wonderful romance . This movie is reminiscent of & quot ; My Dinner with Andre & quot ; in that it consisits ( almost ) solely of a converstaion between the two main characters ! The cinematography of Vienna is wonderful and the young jilted American ( Hawke ) has such awesome chemistry with the brainy French student ( Delpy ) . Did they indeed meet again at the train station in one year ? Who knows -- the great stort told in the movie , however , would be tainted if they actually did !
