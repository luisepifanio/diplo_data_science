I 've seen this one lots of times . I believe it to be a true and accurate depiction of the settings and circumstances . Michael Caine does an outstanding job in his role.Even though this is an older film , it still has appeal . Because of the place and time period , no special effects were required to film it . Of all the Zulu films I have seen , including the recent mini series & quot ; Zhaka Zulu & quot ; , I think this one is the best . And for this price , it 's well worth the purchase price .
