is even greater with Blue Ray technology . Watching Bobbie Duvall racing across the Western plains , chased by Indian savages was breathtaking on a 19 inch TV screen . Imagine it on a 46 inch high def T.V . with Blue Ray technology . This is the finest acted Western ever made . Even Robert Urich and Ricky Schroder had all-star performances . Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were fantastic as former Texas Rangers Woodrow Call and Gus McRae , whose relationship rivals any in film history . A must see for any fan of the old West .
