This film had one good intention : a decent cast . It lacked direction , however , and seemed to be adrift in a sea of identity confusion . Is it a thriller ? Not quite . Is it a `` buddy '' film . Well , not really . It it a romance ? Uh-uh . It is a mish-mash of all of the above . There were some excellent action sequences ( many incredibly unbelievable ) , especially in the last 20 minutes . Some of the comic interplay between Wesley and Woody was amusing , but far from their chemistry in `` Jump '' . J-Lo 's character served no purpose except to show a little skin . She slowed the pace down for the first hour of the movie , it seemed like watching it in slow motion . It could have been an excellent action-packed buddy film of the Lethal Weapon genre if only the writers offered us a decent script . Instead , we got disconnected plotting and a whole lot of far-fetched antics . And Robert Blake should have `` Virginia Baked '' tattooed on his forehead . And what was up with Cooper 's character ? It seemed like the writers of the script came up with an idea for a serial killer/robber plot , but then could n't figure out what to do with him and wrote him out of the film halfway through without any resolution for his motive or background . Instead , the writers might have just recently spent an evening watching `` The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 '' and switched tracks , so to speak , and said `` hey , this might be a good idea for that new Harrelson/J-Lo/Snipes film we have to provide a script for tomorrow . '' The writing and direction seems to be spontaneous , and NOT in a good way .
