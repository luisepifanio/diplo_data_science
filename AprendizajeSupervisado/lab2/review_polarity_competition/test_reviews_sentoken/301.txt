It was difficult for me to sit through parts of this film , but I forced myself to watch all of it , and it changed my life.It forced me to think about personal responsibility in our everyday choices . I never realized the horrors of factory farming and the sick extent to which animals are exploited . Once you know , you ca n't pretend everything is ok.This is a very important film .
