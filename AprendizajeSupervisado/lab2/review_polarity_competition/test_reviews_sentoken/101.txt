I just watched this DVD version of Convoy and was a little disappointed . Being a fan of the movie , I was all excited to get the DVD only to find out that some of the movie is missing ; specifically the scene when the reporter is talking with the Duck . The Duck tells the reporter to ask the rest of the convoy why they are there and he does . The DVD version of this scene has a broken conversation with the Duck , then the Preacher , and back to the Duck . In addition to this the sound quality is not that great and a few times it is mute for a second . At the very beginning of the movie the video jumps once or twice but is good for the most part . The DVD says it is `` Digitally Remastered '' to me it looks like cheezyflicks.com recorded this movie from HBO and `` Digitally Remastered '' their copy.Personally I would recommend finding a good VHS version and burn it to DVD yourself or wait till it is released from the film industry .
