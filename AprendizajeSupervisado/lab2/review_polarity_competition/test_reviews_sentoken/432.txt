I first saw this movie over 20 years ago and did n't like it because I did n't like any of the characters . Flashforward two decades and I now like at least six of them . That tells you the way time builds human understanding . As a kid I assumed that the world was a good place , but now I know it to be equal parts good and evil . Few films showcase this eventuality more artfully and powerfully than the Road Warrior . This is an amazing production and I truly envy you if you 've never seen it before.The Road Warrior is both entertaining and deeply enlightening . There is more truth in its portrayal of human nature than a million self-help books and a hundred Hollywood movies . Civilization 's veneer is thin . Without police and a government we would revert to shameful behaviors and attempt to survive by any means necessary . Max and the Gyro Captain are great but I still think that the feral boy character steals the spotlight from everyone else . The movie also tells us much about the nature of friendship along with the way we quickly bond with others in times of need . If you have n't seen it please do .
