After previously having nothing but on screen affection for each other in the classics , Romancing The Stone and The Jewel Of The Nile , Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the married couple from hell in this darkly humorous black comedy . A compelling movie from beginning to end with its fast , furious dialogue , great performances all round and shocks along the way , especially towards the end of the film . Top marks must go to Kathleen Turner who gives her character an edge of realism . The cast also includes Danny Devito who plays the bickering Roses ' divorce lawyer . Nothing short of a comic masterpiece ! Highly recommended !
