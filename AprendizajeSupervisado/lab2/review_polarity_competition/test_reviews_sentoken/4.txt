I purchased all the Inspector Morse DVDs and have watched the episodes over and over again . I 've never found a series I like better . Perhaps it 's because the classically beautiful city of Oxford is not only the physical location for most of the stories , but also an ideal intellectual setting for plots featuring characters engaged in the life of the mind.The first time I heard Morse repeating the last verses of Tennyson 's poem `` Ulysses '' to Chief Superintendent Strange -- '' Tho ' much is taken , much abides ; and tho'We are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven , that which we are , we are ... . '' -- I knew I was hooked on Morse for life.I 'm glad PBS decided to produce the Inspector Lewis series with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse . While I 've been happy to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis , it 's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me most of their predecessor , the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse.If you enjoy Morse , Lewis , and Hathaway as I do , you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius , available at Amazon . It 's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the response people have to a controversial viewpoint dating back to the Nicene Council .
