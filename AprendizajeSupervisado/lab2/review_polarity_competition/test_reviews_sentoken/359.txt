I love this OAV series . Depending on my mood , it 's either the best or the second-best anime OAV series I 've seen . Part of this is because the two main characters are just plain nice people . There 's SO many anime where the main characters are annoying , stupid , stubbornly clueless , rude , or any of the above . It 's not always necessary to have the main characters be clearly flawed in some way , and in this case , they are n't . If Keiichi has any flaw , it 's that he 's a bit too tentative around Belldandy , but can you BLAME him ? She IS a goddess , after all.And they still have conflicts and problems -- an important thing to remember when watching the show is that even for good people , prior mistakes can catch up with you . The climactic scenes never fail to bring tears to my eyes . If you 're a romantic , get this anime . You wo n't regret it .
