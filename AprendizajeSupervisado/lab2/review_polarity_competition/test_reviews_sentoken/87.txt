Well , it is challenging to raise a negative voice against such a & quot ; cult & quot ; movie , but I ca n't restrain myself . I have watched it in 1997 and still it remains one of the worst big screen blockbusters I 've ever seen ( although I LOVE to watch blockbusters and sci-fi and actions movies especially ) . The plot is universally known and can fit within 3 lines , the movie is full of tarnished cliches ( slimy octopus-like aliens who I do n't know how can operate their flying sources , brave and courageous pilots and soldiers in general , but usually unhappy in family life or & quot ; whose wife is just to give birth to a baby & quot ; , a very cute and young President with a dying old wife ) and cheep pathos and sickly sweet patriotism . The famouse scene of a giant UFO demolishing the White House and surroundings is good , but when Mr President is informed that several million people perished and he even does not blank a tear ... I think you missed a good scene here . It is also a pity to watch good actors performing in such rubbish ( got some good dough though , no doubt ) .The theme of aliens conquering Earth and after initial success receive a good kick in the a ... . from humans is eternal and it raises our self-esteem , but I 'd like to ask the guys making these movies - respect the audience , not all of us have such bad taste or no taste at all or are kids under 12 . One of my friends , an American , said : & quot ; When watching this movie , during first hour I was proud that I 'm American , after it finished - I was ashamed that we 've produced such a movie ... & quot ; However , I would advise everyone to watch it and decide for him/herself and see .
