DIRTY WORK sets out what it accomplishes and that is to entertain on an uncomplicated low denominator level . Norm MacDonald ( Mitch ) and Arte Lange ( Sam ) -- ( SNL meets MAD TV ) -- are two losers who open up a revenge-for-hire business in order to raise money for Sam 's Dad ( Jack Warden ) who needs a heart transplant . This sets up several gags as people hire these guys for various pranks most of which are hilarious ( shaving the evil `` Beared Lady '' at a carnival sideshow hired by a jilted `` little person '' ) . This leads up to the main plot of an evil real estate developer Cole ( Chris McDonald-HAPPY GILMORE ) who hires the pranksters to do his 'dirty work ' to have a building condemned . Realising , that they may hurt the very people they 're trying to fight for , they must undo their destruction . Norm MacDonald 's SNL persona is evident here as he uses some of his dead-pan , understated schtick he used during his tenure on the show especially when he did the Weekend Update segments ( i.e . `` Note to Self.. '' etc ) . This is helped by the casting of Arte Lange who had his moments on Mad-TV and is now one of Howard Stern 's posse on Stern 's syndicated radio show . Lastly , the movie has some funny cameos to help the plot along ( John Goodman , Chevy Chase , Chris Farley , Gary Coleman and Adam Sandler and Don Rickles ) along with love interest played by Traylor Howard ( who seems to be on a failed TV pilot a few times during a televison season ) as Kathy . Overall , sophomoric and low brow on a very hilarious level . Note : Classic line as Mitch and Sam are in a bar fight . Mitch ( MacDonald ) takes out his pocket recorder after getting beat up and say 's `` Note to self ... Learn how to fight ! ''
