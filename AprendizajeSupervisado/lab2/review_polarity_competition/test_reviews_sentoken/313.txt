This movie was one of the best movies that I have ever seen . It did not get the publicity that it deserved unfortunately . It was filmed here in Charlotte , North Carolina ( where I live ) and it was n't even advertised heavily here in our theatres , and did n't stay long at any of them . I just do n't understand the reasoning . Everyone should see this movie , and reflect on what life has given them . We all have to work for what we want ; We ca n't expect life to hand us everything on a silver platter . James Garner 's spotlight role is ingeniously done . Drew Fuller is excellent . Abigail Breslin should get an oscar..what a little actress !
