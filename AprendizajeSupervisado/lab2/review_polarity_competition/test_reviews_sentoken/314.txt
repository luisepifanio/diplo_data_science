As a German native , I bought this Dvd for my class , this is my 3rd German DvD and again not a good one ! The sound effect is so bad , you ca n't hear the person talking but the backnoise is super loud ! Also the top sights in cities are swans , my class got good laugh out of it.I 've been to almost all cities in this DvD and there is more than 3 seconds of city and 5minutes of swans . Really bad- I wish I could get my money back ! I only give 2 stars , since is shows more than only munich , octoberfest and the hofbrauhaus !
