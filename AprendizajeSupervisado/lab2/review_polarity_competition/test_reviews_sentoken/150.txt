Had I realized this was a Madacy production before I bought it , I would have made a different decision . I learned long ago to avoid Madacy titles because of their poor production quality , but there was nothing on the box indicating Madacy involvement ( it is there but almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass ) . The packaging was quite spectacular , unlike Madacy titles I had purchased in the past . Metal case with color printing and there was even a wonderful full-color book inside outlining many of the great pioneers of aviation and their aircraft with superb production quality . So , I was unprepared for the poor quality of the video content inside . I own many of the videos from disc 4 in VHS format , and could not believe how badly these have been reproduced on DVD . I can do a better job of transferring the VHS to DVD using my analog-to-digital converter ! As other reviewers have pointed out ( too bad I saw these posts after my purchase ) , the documentary is not organized in any meaningful pattern and fails to deliver on its promise of describing the history of aviation .
