These shows have never looked better ! When first shown on television most stations ran 16mm prints . Now we can enjoy these from their pristine 35mm masters ! Since the first season was way better than the second , both seaseons are being included on all DVDs ( fewer people would buy the second season ) . The first season boasts some of the only filmed copies of their vaudeville routines , the story was only an excuse for the boys to go somewhere for the routines to happen . The second season was more story driven ( they had used up their routines ) .The only negative thing about these DVDs is the cost ! Some shows sell entire seasons for the price of four Abbott & Costello shows.This meager offering is : # 1 `` Lou Falls for Ruby '' ( aka The Pigeon ) from the second season , Lou falls for a gangster 's girlfriend. # 2 `` Hillary 's Father '' ( aka The Music Lovers ) from the first season , Lou tries to learn to sing to impress Hillary 's Father. # 3 `` Uncle Ruppert '' ( aka Uncle from New Jersey ) from the second season , Lou fakes a rich uncle to avoid being evicted. # 4 `` Bingo 's Troubles '' ( aka Bingo ) from the first season , Lou needs to get their pet chimp a license , but Lou geta s marriage liscense .
