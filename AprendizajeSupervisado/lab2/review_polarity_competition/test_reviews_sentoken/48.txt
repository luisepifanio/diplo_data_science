English film made by the director of & quot ; Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells & quot ; . Lock Stock was a classic and did well in most countries but America . Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements . It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists . The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one . It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond . Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches . The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function . Even Brad Pitt is good .
