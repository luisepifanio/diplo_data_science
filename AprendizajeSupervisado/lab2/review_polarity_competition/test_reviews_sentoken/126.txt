Oh , please release The Equalizer on DVD , complete seasons . It is an excellent show and I ca n't find it anywhere on TV anymore . I miss it a lot . & quot ; Manon & quot ; is a pretty good episode , but as others have stated here , not the series best . The show touted some excellent guest actors over it 's run . Everyone should watch it if they get a chance . Fans of Woodward should check out the movie & quot ; Mister Johnson , & quot ; with Pierce Brosnan .
