Down right pathetic . It 's safe to say that this is and I will mark it down as Stephen Dorff ( Cecil B. Demented , Blade , Entropy ) and Christian Slater 's ( Pump Up The Volume , True Romance , Heathers ) worst movie they ever did . Slater is this paranormal expert who 22 years ago was part of a lab experiment in which tested on the children in an orphanage . Slater hunts down artifacts from a lost civilization ... he was once part of a top elite government group that tracks down a type of creature that preys in the dark and hates the light and no I am not talking about vampires ... .to put it to you clearly they look like the mutated children of Godzilla . Slater teams up with ex fling/archeologist Tara Reid ( Van Wilder , Urban Legend , Cruel Intentions ) and his old buddy who he used to work for in the elite government group ... .played by Dorff . All threw out the movie we suffer from big pulsating headaches while we watch a badly scripted , sloppily directed movie with corny twists and turns in which we know who is gon na die and live . Directed by House Of The Dead director Uwe Boll and I can tell you this movie is Bolls**t. He cant direct crap . What a waste of actors and what a waste of my time . Divert this toxic waste . Why , well if you wan na suffer with action scenes with music scores of heavy metal and a corny love scene with Reid and Slater with the cheesiest music ... this is your ticket .
