Someone please tell me what the point of this film was ? The 1996 film 101 Dalmatians was a remake and now they 're doing a sequel to a remake ? That is seriously quite odd . Even though this movie is much better than 101 Dalmatians from 1996 , I still do n't really see a reason to sequelize the movie . Anyway I really did n't see much values in this family film , apart from good ol ' Glenn Close and the dogs . Yes , the dogs are still very cute and make the movie bearable enough . However , the story is absurd , the typical predictability deal is here in this movie and I did n't laugh very much . Apart from the ending where Cruella literally gets baked , this film is pretty much comedy-free . Kids will find it hard to laugh at this flick and to generally enjoy this film too . Even they 're little minds will not be tricked by the movies dotty silliness . Adults will be dragged along by kids to see this sequel , but I 'm sure none of them will think too much of it . Sure , 102 Dalmatians has some good points - the groovy opening song , Glenn Close 's excellent performance , the funny ending and the cuteness of the dogs - but ultimately it does n't succeed . This is a sequel that you will only be bothered watching while you 're one a plane or a boat or something just to pass the time . I 'll ask again , someone please tell me the point of this movie ? NOTE : 102 Dalmatians does look extremely neat in Widescreen Edition , so if you are thinking of buying it , this is the format I recommend it in .
