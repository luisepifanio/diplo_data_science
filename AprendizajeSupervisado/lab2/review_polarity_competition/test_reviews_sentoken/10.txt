What everyone else has said about this release is true . The sound quality is poor , with considerable background humm/buzz . The picture is squashed and the movie has been edited.One the of my favorite parts of the movie was Chip Davis ' score . Maybe someday a `` real '' , properly formatted , DVD will come out , with at least SOME bonus material . Perhaps Chip can even provide an isolated score for us C.W . McCall and Mannheim Steamroller fans . But this current release is a total piece of junk . It 's only good for those who had n't seen it in years , and then for one viewing only.2010 EDIT : Once I got an LCD screen to replace my old tube-TV , I found it had a few different `` widescreen '' settings . Each of them display the screen stetched to a different ratio . One day I had a thought , what I put in this CONVOY DVD and try the different settings ? Sure enough , one of them compensated for the odd ratio that was one of the many flaws of this release . So , there is a way around that one . But the poor audio and edits all remain , and I wo n't budge on my 1-star overview of this particular relase of the movie .
