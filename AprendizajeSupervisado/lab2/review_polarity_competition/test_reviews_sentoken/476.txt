The hilarious Miss M does it again ! Her timing is fab and she nails the delivery . Nobody can tell off God quite like Bette as trash novelist , Jackie Susann . While the movie was not a knock-your-socks-off hit , the critics are wrong . With perfectly cast supporting players , a super-ditzy 70s-style score by none other than Burt Bacharach , and wonderful costuming and sets , the film was very enjoyable and I recommend it to those who actually have a sense of humor . Stockard Channing ( who really shines in over-the-top roles ) is incomparable and a perfect match to Bette . Her best lines are second only to Bette 's conversations with God and her editor . Master of the stage , Nathan Lane , delivers his usual outstanding performance as the endearing , funny , supportive husband and handler of Bette 's wacky , exceedingly self-centered Susann . Bette and Nathan are like cream and sugar . David Hyde Pierce brings Niles ' charm and wonderful sensitivity to his character as Bette 's editor . John Cleese , always a very funny guy , does n't get nearly enough screen time or lines , but makes the very best of it anyway.So what if the bio was n't accurate , it never is . And the acting was not overdone at all , it was meant to be flamboyant ! Will I see it again ? You bet ! If only just to listen Bette tell it like it is . Way to go , Miss M !
