I too have been searching for this disney movie for years . I remember seeing it as a child and still remember some of the most soaring and inspirational music which made quite an impression on me . I intend to see it in this instant video rental format , but i would really love to buy a copy of this wonderful film ... vhs , dvd , whatever !
