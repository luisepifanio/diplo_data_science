I actually mistakened this DVD set for The Century Of Flight made by Time Life Video in the late 1990s . ( Please make THIS series in DVD format ! ) . When you look at the two , there is virtually no comparison . Madacy 's A Century of Flight covers very little about the history of aerial warfare . It has a brief segment on World War I ; World War II takes up a whole disc but is told only from the American point-of-view . Korea , Vietnam , and the Gulf War are not covered at all ! The series only covers the history of U.S aviation , exempting of course the topics listed above . My verdict : the series seems like something an elementary school class might find interesting ( only because they 'd rather watch TV than do written assignments ) but to someone seriously interested in aviation ; like the previous review says : Avoid at all costs .
