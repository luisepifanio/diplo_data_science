Boy Wonder is not a superhero movie . Although it shares a similar origin story to many of our favorite superheroes , Boy Wonder is about a kid , Sean , that witnesses his mother get murdered . He is haunted by this memory and decides to hunt down the man that killed his mom . Throughout the story , he 'll seek justice for others usually in a violent way ( often fist-fighting or shooting ) . There are other psychological aspects that you begin to notice during the second half of the film when you realize Sean may actually be mentally ill . The ending has some decent twists . The emotional story , the thrilling action , and even the comedy between the cops make this film a great one . The acting was great , and the music really stood out to me . Definitely one of the better films released recently . Is it a pure superhero film ? No . Do n't expect a huge budget with amazing special effects and mutated villains . This is a realistic film of a young man seeking justice.There is some violence and blood throughout the film , there is no sex or nudity so it 's pretty safe . If you 're even slightly interested , Boy Wonder is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/24/12 . I highly recommend you check it out .
