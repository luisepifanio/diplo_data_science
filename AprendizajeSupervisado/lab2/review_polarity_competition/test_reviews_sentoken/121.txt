One day I was feeling down and went to the video store to check out a movie . I came across Harold and Maude and decided to give it a try . When I watched that movie , I laughed , I cried , and I felt so deeply moved . If you have n't seen it , it 's hard to explain what makes H & amp ; M so wonderful . It 's an experience that I think everyone should have . I have forced most of my friends to watch it . Yes , they initially think it 's creepy about the age difference between Harold and Maude . Yes , it 's difficult convincing college kids to watch a 30+ year old movie . But , when it 's over , they too can see what makes Harold and Maude my all-time favorite movie .
