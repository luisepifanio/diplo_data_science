This is based on the VHS version of the movie `` Roman Holiday '' played by Audrey Hupburn and Gregory Peck . Story is simple and elegant . A newsman ( Peck ) accidently come across a drug-influenced certain Eastern European princess ( Hepburn ) who escaped from her resident Palace while on her official visit to Rome , the story was evolved around the couple , the camera friend of Peck , the Security guards who were desperately trying to get her back to Palace , and Peck 's boss and the neighboring landlord . It is refreshing to see Peck / Hepburn 's affectionate but innocent love affair after you have seen so many one-night-stand affairs in today 's movies . Superb performance by both . This movie has brought Hepburn to super Stardom . Alas , they do n't make movie like this any more . We do n't have actor / actress like Peck and Hepburn neither . A movie you must see and appreciate .
