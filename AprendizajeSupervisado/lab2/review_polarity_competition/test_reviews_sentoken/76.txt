This particular movie is one of the more closer modern day films of the church secrets . You do n't have to like this movie , but it does approach one of the biggest secret of the church : `` What an actual church is '' . I personally like this movie , it is an intellectual film at heart . I agree that this should n't be compared to The Exorcist . That original movie has I think more rawness to it , this movie is slick , stylistic , and extremely methodical . I thought this to have the most disturbing imagery , next to the original hellrasier .
