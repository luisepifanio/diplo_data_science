The director 's Son is an idiot for messing up one of my all-time favourite movies . The re-arrangement of scenes means the story no longer flows . Changing the visit with Freya gives the impression that it was her words that had the biggest influence on Erik not the death of the failed rape victim . Some of the best scenes ( Vikings about to kill each other with swords rather than drown for one ) are cut completely and there is even a key scene when they are about to go over the edge of the world and the key characters lips are moving but the sound is cut . Dreadful shame ! I was very disappointed .
