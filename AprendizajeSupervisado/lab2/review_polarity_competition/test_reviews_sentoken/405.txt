This is a very interesting adaptation of Alice in Wonderland , featuring a plethora of major British actors from the time this movie was made . Note that today 's younger audience , weened on an MTV diet of rapid cuts and incredible CGI , may find this slow . But if one can get beyond that , it 's most definitely worth a watch.That said , this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE . It 's not clear what source they used for the transfer , but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie , with wow and flutter horribly apparent . This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score . If you have any sense of pitch , you 'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings ! The video quality is pretty horrible , as well -- worse than standard cable . A real travesty .
