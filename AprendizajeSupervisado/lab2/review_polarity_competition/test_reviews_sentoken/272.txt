As a fan of the Battlestar Galactica series , I was really looking forward to watching Razor , in part because it was supposed to be an intro to season 4 , and in part because the series is so stunning I figured they could not go wrong . They did . Not only was this a very lackluster digression into back stories that we already knew , it seriously muddied the waters.Razor is supposed to be the story of the Pegasus . It amplifies the stories of Admiral Cain , the Cylon ( No 6 ) that had worked aboard the Pegasus , and Lee Adama 's role as Captain of the Pegasus -- all told from the perspective ( more or less ) of Cain 's assistant Kendra Shaw . The story should have given us new insights , or at least answered some lingering questions . It did neither . There was no information that was presented in this story that we did n't already know from watching the series . Going into details was not only unecessary , it some respects it actually took away from the dramatic impact of the series . ( Did we really have to know the specifics of the relationship between Cain and No 6 ? How was that important ? ) Introducing an entirely new main character , Kendra Shaw , certainly did not help . We did n't know her well enough to identify with her , and , frankly , I found her a bit dull.But the worst aspect of this film was that it ran against what we already knew about characters we had come to love and respect . The first rule of writing ( one of the many first rules ) is that you protect your characters . You can kill them , but what you ca n't do is destroy their integrity , especially not for the sake of a plot contrivance . Admiral Adama 's integrity was seriously compromised at the end of Razor , and for no good reason . The story simply was n't significant enough to warrant tarnishing the strongest character of the series.If you skip Razor , you will have missed nothing . In fact , you might even enjoy the rest of the series more if you do .
