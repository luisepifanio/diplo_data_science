Aarrgghh ! The jacket of `` Cross Bones '' depicts a promising panoramic scene of nautical siege involving a full-masted pirate ship beneath an impressive turbaned skull with eye patch . This scene unaccountably does not appear in the movie . What is offered are a few boring minutes of half-hearted swashbuckling amongst the pirate mateys aboard a remarkably spic-and-span `` pirate ship '' -- a suspiciously anachronistic trawler bearing no gun ports and possessing limited deck area for swashbuckling . Red Bones , the fearsome pirate chief , grimaces through his moderate vocabulary as if motivated by heart-burn , throwing in an occasional `` Aarrgghh ! '' -- presumably for the pirate effect , or possibly just belching . In his cannibalistic reincarnation ( terrifying curse ) , Bones achieves new heights , raising his performance level to that of having a bowel movement . When the `` incredible treasure '' is finally unearthed , the delusion is scuttled by a spectacle of garage-sale items . The plot -- movies should have plots -- concerns the filming of a reality show in which the participants spend most of their time spouting senseless bilgewater that leaves one praying for the violent death of the script writer . The only recent movie that degenerates to a category of comparable depths is Asylum Pictures ' `` War of the Worlds '' ( actually , any Asylum Pictures production would suffice ) in which the film jacket promises entertainment and delivers indigestion . Rating of one star indicates one star too many .
