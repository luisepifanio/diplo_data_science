While the picture quality excells , several audio tracks are inexplicably missing . I even dug out my VHS copy and compared the two , and sure enough , there are several places in which there are missing sound effects ! I ca n't explain it , but someone must have accidentally tossed an audio track in the bin as they remastered the sound . This DVD does n't give me reason enough to get rid of my old VHS copy . Your best bet would be to comb online auctions or browse pawn shops for an original video release .
