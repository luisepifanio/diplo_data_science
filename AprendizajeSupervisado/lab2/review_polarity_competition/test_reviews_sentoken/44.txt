This DVD is dated and boring . A friend told me to try a rebounding DVD becasue they were a lot of fun . She and I are both in pretty good shape . This was clearly geared to seniors , or people not accustomed to exercise . I did the CD once and wo n't use it again . I could get a better workout just rebounding on my own while watching TV .
