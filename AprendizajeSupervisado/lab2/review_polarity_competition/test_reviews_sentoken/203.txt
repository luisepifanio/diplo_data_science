Someone at Warner Home Video needs to pull their head out and get this amazing concert film back on the shelves ! This is Joni at her best with the greatest backing group of musicians in history ! Pat Metheny , Lyle Mays , Jaco Pastorius , Michael Brecker and Don Alias provide an amazing platform for Joni 's songs to spring from . And it 's all set in the beautiful Santa Barbara County Bowl , one the great outdoor ampitheaters in the world . Plus Joni has added some interesting visuals , not to mention snipets of James Dean in & quot ; Rebel Without a Cause & quot ; to liven up this wonderful piece . So why ca n't you or I buy it ? Warner 's has kept it out of print and is really dropping the ball on this one . Send them a nasty e-mail and tell them to reissue it now in DVD and VHS !
