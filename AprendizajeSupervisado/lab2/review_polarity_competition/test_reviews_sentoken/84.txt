Let me say from the get-go that I truly believe The Breakfast Club to be one of the best movies of all time . So I was excited to hear about a new edition . Sad to say , it is simply not worth it -- at all ! So what of the music was remastered ? Yippy Shermer Skippy . If the film stock had been restored and remastered , it might be different . But the music/soundtrack ? Yawn.Then there 's the fact that there are no extras , no deleted scenes , nothing.And lastly , I was majorly annoyed to be forced to watch four movie ads prior to getting to the menu . You CAN NOT hit Stop , you CAN NOT hit Menu , you CAN NOT hit Pause ... once this DVD is in , you will always , always have to sit through four movie ads before you get to the menu ! `` Action forbidden by disc '' is what you 'll see . Lame ! Keep your old DVD copy . The picture is the same , and that 's what counts . Call me when the real extras edition shows up with interviews , extra scenes , etc .
