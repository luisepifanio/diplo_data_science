Shaolin Wooden Men is my most favorite of Jackie Chan 's early films . However , in my opinion the new Columbia/Tristar DVD version is such a terrible print of the film that I regret buying it . The entire upper 60 % of the screen has a horrible pea green cast to it , making everyone look seasick . The contrast has been increased , presumably to 'remove ' scratches , but this has darkened so much of the film that you can no longer see any detail in the woodwork of buildings , the shadows of trees , people 's hair and faces , etc.The worst part is this print is missing over 9 and a half minutes of opening footage that showed Jackie demonstrating the five Kung Fu disciplines used in the movie , as well as his first encounter with the wooden men , the opening overture and introductory scenes of Shaolin life.The one redeeming thing about the Columbia/Tristar DVD version is that it is indeed true letterbox . As such you can truly see the full layout of the film as originally intended . The sound quality is also quite good , considering the age of the film . But despite , this is still the only instance where I 've ever preferred a Beverly Wilshire/Telefilms DVD version of a Jackie Chan film ( fullscreen , scratches , video artifacts and all ) to a remastered Columbia/Tristar DVD version . I am disappointed .
