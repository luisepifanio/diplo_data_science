Nothing new happens in this movie . It has plenty of action , mostly in the form of explosions , but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward . The viewer goes out where he came in.Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer 's intelligence with lazy plot devices . For example , there are scenes involving the movement of massive , clanking machines , yet characters are n't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them . Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline , or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.The movie is riddled with such devices . They play out , one after another , for about two hours . Nothing else happens . We learn nothing new.My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series .
