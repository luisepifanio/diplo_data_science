I 'm overweight by about 50 pounds and had never done a workout video in my life before trying Jillian Michaels ' 30-Day Shred ( AWESOME ) . When you live in Minnesota , the outdoor sports and exercise options you enjoyed year-round are availble only a few months a year , so I needed to try something to help me get in shape . After trying the 30-Day Shred and loving it , I tried No More Trouble Zones and love it , too . They are completely different , though . 30-Day Shred has more cardio , so I do that 4 days/week and do No More Trouble Zones 2 days/week . I love that this workout DVD is broken up into short circuits so that you can choose to do all of them or only 1 or a few if , for example , you have young kids who will only give you 20 minutes to workout , if you 're lucky . Even on my first day , I felt incredibly challenged , strengthened , and excited . I could literally feel strenghtening of every inch of the muscles on which I was focusing . I `` burned '' for the next day , but it was actually motivating ( and not painful , just sore ) . I think Jillian is motivational and appreciate her talking you thorough the exercises , but you can always mute if if you just want to do the exercises .
