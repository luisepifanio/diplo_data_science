A near-perfect film version of a downright gloomy play , & quot ; The Glass Menagerie & quot ; successfully captures the atmosphere of futility and hopelessness that permeated the play and made it such a success . The choice of actors is quite good , and I am thankful that the complete plot was preserved , rather than attempting to alter it in favor of a more active storyline . Eccentric , yes , depressing , yes , effective - quite so .
