I live with an LA High School teacher ; we are both in our fifties yet we both enjoy teen oriented movies , at least to some degree . However , we are also highly sensitive to the distance from reality in most of these movies , and this one kept us awake and interested . Crazy/Beautiful may be another fairly tale reworking of the star-crossed lovers theme , but it also presents its characters with a gritty realism . These kids in this movie are a lot like real kids that we know and see everyday . Kirsten Dunst is still portraying a teenager , but proves she can handle adult complexity . Jay Hernandez is wonderfully unaffected . The story is in many respects by the numbers , but it turns most of the movie cliches upside down - the rich kids father approves of the poor kid - it 's his own daughter he has trouble with . The Latino kid is appealing to the white girls , but he is n't a white boy in a Latino skin , he is comfortable in his identity . I do n't want to say too much more because I do n't want to ruin the story for those who have n't seen it.This is a fun film to watch with superb performances . As others have said , it has no villains just people who look like them from the vantage of the main characters . It 's a feel good teen movie with something to interest the brain .
