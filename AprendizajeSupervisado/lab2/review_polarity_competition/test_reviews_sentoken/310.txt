Michael Jackson 's heartbreaking death drew me , like so many others , to his music . Rediscovering familiar songs & videos was fun , but most meaningful to me has been acquiring an appreciation for the songs I was not as familiar with . Earth Song tops the list . The music video is hard to watch because it shows man 's overwhelmingly cruel treatment of animals and the rape of the earth & rainforests , no doubt due to greed . I believe the song and video are pure Michael Jackson genius . The music is not only beautiful but haunting , and it sticks in your head -- along with the causes it promotes . It will move you to tears , and leave no doubt Michael put his heart and soul into crying out about these atrocities . It is a lasting , forever gift ( along with all of the rest of his music ) that he gave to us in his effort to make the world a better place . The best gift we could give back to him in return , would be to DO something -- however large or small , to stop the cruel slaughtering of animals & horrific destruction of earth & rainforests . There is no way you can go wrong adding this DVD to your collection . You will watch these videos again and again -- each and every one .
