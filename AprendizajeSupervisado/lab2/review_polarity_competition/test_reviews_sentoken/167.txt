I saw this at the MET HD . The production is a nightmare . So much that I hated the opera . Florez is superb but Natalie is past her prime after her many operations . If you want to see a traditional staging in a Swiss village get the one with the amazing soprano Gueterrez . Now if we can only get Florez together with Gueterrez .
