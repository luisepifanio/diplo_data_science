Could n't even get passed the second scene . I 'm a very open minded person about this kind of stuff too , but the movie was completely overstimulating . A non-stop ... ( REALLY . non-stop . every scene in the movie is filmed this way ) ... . montage of overlapping images and LOUD music that drowns out the narration.I REALLY wanted to watch this movie as I was very curious about the information on it.IT IS TOO HARD TO WATCH.Philip Gardiner lacks any and all GNOSIS when it comes to film direction.Truly . TRULY . AWFUL .
