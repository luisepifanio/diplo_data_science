I 'm a strong believer , so I give this movie two stars for getting the main point right - that people are often mad at God and unable to see the rottenness in their own hearts . Also I liked how the movie addressed how often Satan is n't even seen as real.But I could n't give it more stars as it seemed disjointed and the acting was horrible and the writing even worse . I 'm sure everyone who worked on this project put in a ton of effort but it 's one of those movies that makes Christians look pitiful , really , that we do n't know how to relate to people where they are really at . In my opinion it only scraped the surface of peoples ' real struggles in experiencing evil on our planet , so came off as superficial and , well , unintelligent and , patronizing - which is what much of the world expects from us . I know these are harsh words but sometimes I think movies/projects like this can do more harm than good - solidifying the stereotype non-Christians can have of us and our message .
