It 's too bad so few people know about this film . I 'm a sucker for films about redemption for us very imperfect humans . The acting is superb . The story is moving . When I see films like this , I do n't feel so alone in the world . There are many films about redemption ( see Martin Scorcese ) , but for me , there will never be enough . This is a real jewel .
