This was a scope movie , with a theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 . This DVD is panned and scanned and it ruins the movies dynamism and impact . The action scenes are terrific and truly exciting but THIS is not the way to watch them . A shameful DVD with unacceptable sound and picture quality . Pray for an SE re-release and buy that instead .
