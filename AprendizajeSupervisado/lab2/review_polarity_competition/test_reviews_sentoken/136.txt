OK . I 'm sorry , but Drew Barrymore was just completely wrong for this movie . I get the `` I 'm 30 and I 'm behind in my life because I put everything on hold for a guy '' thing , but she seemed like she was trying to be some intense young 20-something . I really wanted her to act her age , which was unfortunate because all that eye make-up just made her look like she was 40 years old . Now , I like Drew Barrymore and have enjoyed many of her movies . But she and Justin Long really seemed like they were in two different age groups . The chemistry between them was forced and the desperation of a long-distance relationship just was n't very convincing . Justin Long was I think a good fit for this role , but I do n't think the character development was complete . He did seem to be just coasting along while Drew was overdoing it , but again I think he was held back by the poor chemistry with his co-star . I have seen him do terrific work in other movies ( 'Dreamland ' and 'He 's Just Not That Into You ' are excellent examples ) , but this movie just had numerous issues all around.I felt that this movie was trying to be funny in the manner of 'There 's Something About Mary ' or '40-Year Old Virgin , ' but it just was n't . The attempts at gross humor ( especially all that swearing ) were misplaced and forced and took away from the sweetness of the story . Christina Applegate was just plain mean , and men in general were portrayed as idiots . The one bright spot in the movie was seeing an excellent band , The Boxer Rebellion , which we see playing on stage at a club in San Fran.This could have been a really good story in different hands and with a different cast . It just really missed the mark .
