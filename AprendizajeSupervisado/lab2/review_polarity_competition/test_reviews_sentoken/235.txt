Lonesome Dove is a cinematic masterpiece based on Larry Mcmurtry 's timeless classic of Western Literature by the same title . More than just a movie , Lonesome Dove presents insights into many aspects of life . It contains an underlying meaning going far beyond plot . It is one of the best examples of interpretive cinema to be found . Lonesome Dove presents to the viewer , moral lessons while it entertains . More than this though , Lonesome Dove just makes you feel good . It is an escape from everyday life through simple dialogue and lovable believable charachters that carry the reader away from his world and place him in Lonesome Dove , Texas , a place where life is slower and the hustle and bustle of modern life can not be found . It 's all-star cast led by Danny Glover , Tommy Lee Jones , and Robert Duvall present the charachters as Mcmurtry would have portrayed them . In my opinion , it is impossible to watch the entire six hour classic without tearing up or at least being thoroughly moved , not by its sadness but by its superb portrayal of the stirring emotion that brings with it a real , and lasting sense of joy and contentment . The best one word description of this classic of cinema is & quot ; beautiful & quot ; .Just thinking about this wonderful movie brings a sigh of joy and a lasting feeling of contentment . If you have not seen this excellent work of cinema , then you have not yet arrived .
