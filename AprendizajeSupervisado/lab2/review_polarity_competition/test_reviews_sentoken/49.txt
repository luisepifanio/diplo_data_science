This is an incredible film for the right kind of viewer . It is definitely not for everyone . If you like industry , American history , dark complex characters , action and money , you 'll love it . If you are the kind of viewer who sometimes roots for the bad guy , you 'll love it . This is not a movie for families or people who go to church every Sunday . It is for people who like to see the underbelly of things . We need more of this type of movie in my opinion . Modern movies have become so sugar-coated . I give it an A+ . However , I can totally understand how a lot of people would dislike it . The movie itself is a little threatening and challenging and sinister . Not for everyone , but an incredible film regardless .
