Compared to most hollywood horror movies made in the past decade , this movie is genuinely scary . The set up is perfect , the tension gets under your skin in the first few minutes of the film and never lets up . I ca n't remember the last horror movie that I saw that had me this tense for the entire movie . It is a definite throw back to horror films of the 70 's and early 80 's and that is a very good thing . The acting is supurb and incredibly believable . The music is like another actor and is the best horror soundtrack since halloween . If you want to see what a horror movie should look like and sound like buy this dvd .
