I ordered two potty video 's for my daughter . This one and `` It 's potty time '' . My daughter watched `` It 's Potty Time '' with great interest . I put on Potty Power and she was completely disinterested . I tried to get her to watch it a few other times but she just kept asking for `` the purple one '' which is the color of the DVD of `` it 's Potty Time '' .In addition , I felt potty power with it 's song about things to do while one the toilet taught dawdling , and the wiping section showed kids pulling and pulling on the toilet paper ... great way to teach them to empty a roll.Mine 's going on ebay .
