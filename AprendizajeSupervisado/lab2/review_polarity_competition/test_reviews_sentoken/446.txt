My son is 2 years 4 months and has never shown anything but resistence towards potty training . I purchased this movie about two weeks ago . My son loves the songs and walks around singing them . ( Even my 13 month old stops to watch it . ) He asks for this movie all the time ! He has since gone pee pee in his potty chair and frequently asks to sit on the BIG potty . I am very impressed .
