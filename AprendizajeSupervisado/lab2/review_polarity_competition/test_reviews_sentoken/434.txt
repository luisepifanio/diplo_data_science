It is a toss-up between & quot ; McClintock ! & quot ; and & quot ; The Quiet Man & quot ; for our all time favorite John Wayne movie , so we were very excited to be able to order them both for our new DVD player . Re : & quot ; McClintock ! & quot ; What a disapointment ! The quality ( and I use the term loosely ) of this DVD , released by & quot ; Good Times Video & quot ; is horrible . Wait for an authorized copy , released by the studio ! WE will not buy anything released by Good Times Video again .
