I bought this `` collection '' at Sam Goody for $ 19.99 , and it was another waste of money . The first reason is that there are supposed to be 4 DVDS , but apparently someone made an error when they packaged it because there are only 3 DVDS , so the store gave me a discount . The second reason is that there are no special features , what you have to do is select play and then suffer through the F.B.I . warning and then watch the cheesy animated company logo , and the quality is horrendous . But all the episodes have the original opening and closing theme music , even though it said it did n't ! But please do n't waste your money on this horrible `` collection '' . I still ca n't belive that I bought this after one DVD was missing . Go figure !
