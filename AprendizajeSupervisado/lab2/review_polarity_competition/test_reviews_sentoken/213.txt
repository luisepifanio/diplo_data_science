I was very pleasantly surprised by Session 9 . It has an air of mystery about it from start to finish , it 's well-acted ( even David Caruso manages not to overact ) , and the ending leaves you satisfied but still pondering `` what just happened there ? '' It 's light on gore and concentrates more on the psychological aspects of the main characters . If you like things like `` Blood Simple '' or other psychological thrillers , this is for you .
