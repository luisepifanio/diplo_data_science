No , wait ... that was Godzilla , Alien , Dawn of the Dead , Mortal Kombat , and 28 Days Later . My bad . But with all of the awful knockoffs in this movie , I think we can all see how I made the mistake of confusing THIS with THOSE . I 've been tolerant of other people 's opinions in most of my reviews , but ( and I apologize to those of you who gave it fives ) HOW COULD ANYONE GIVE THIS PIECE OF CRAP , GARBAGE MOVIE FIVE STARS ? ! IF THERE WAS A NEGATIVE SCALE FOR THE RATINGS , I 'D HAVE GIVEN THIS JUNK A -100 ! ! ! This movie has awful acting ! [ ... ] The characters all act the same , and they state the obvious a little too much ... so much so that I think they 're all afflicted with mental problems . The monsters , I admit , were well done , it 's just that they look like the biproduct of a love session between Godzilla and the alien queen . Speaking of love sessions : WHERE DID THE SEX SCENE COME FROM ? ! Tara Reid ( crappy actor # 1 ) walks in and lies down next to Christian Slater ( crappy actor # 2 ) and suddenly , they 're having sex ! ! Sheesh ! Where did that come from ? ! Anyways ... this movie has a stupid plot , and is very confusing . It makes NO sense whatsoever . By the end of the movie , the normal people are done trying to make sense of it and just laughing their butts off . The rest walk out and give it five star ratings like the idiots they are . Not even Tara Reid 's hotness could save this one . Do n't even consider seeing it , you 're running the risk of wasting five bucks . This is probably the only time I 'll say this , but do NOT listen to the people that gave it five stars . They honestly do n't know what they 're talking about .
