I attempted to watch DARK DESCENT but failed . I saw enough to recognize that this seemed to be a remake of OUTLAND which in turn was a Sci-Fi translation of HIGH NOON . Both OUTLAND and HIGH NOON are classics with great casts and well crafted scripts , but DARK DESCENT is a remake of these classics only in the sense that Frankenstein 's Monster is a recreation of humanity . Some of the parts are there , but you do n't want to take them home . There is a lot of dialogue , none memorable , and little action . The plot pacing favors insomniacs . Many of the actors are unknown even in their own native countries , whatever they may be . Let 's not forget the special features , which consist of a menu that offers a single & quot ; choice & quot ; : & quot ; play movie & quot ; , thus demonstrating that the menu 's only useful function is to demonstrate that it has no useful function . I gave the movie one star because it is better than daytime television , but my advise is get OUTLAND and watch the best Space Western ever made .
