This film had poor video quality , horrible acting , an extremely weak story-line and it was directed poorly . I understand that independent films do not have the budget or production values of industry-funded movies , but even by indie film standards - this movie was horrible . I regret spending $ 1.99 to watch this . Even at an amateur level , the videography and acting are below standard . The scenes are so badly done that I found myself chuckling during serious scenes . I would not recommend that anyone watch this film .
