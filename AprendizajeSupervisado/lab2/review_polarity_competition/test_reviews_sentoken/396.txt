WARNING : If you are looking for a DVD of the Terror , there are some awful copies available ! The disc from Master Movies is by FAR the best available . There are no extras to speak of except for some biographical info ( some incorrect ) but the film looks surprisingly good , especially if you boost the black level on your player . AVOID THE OTHER VERSIONS . The Master Movies version is the one with the non-descript grey cover with a small picture of Nicholson . No extras , blah cover , excellent picture for a public domain film .
