This film is potently uplifting . The scene involving DeNiro 's long awaited redemption- the music , his acting , the context , the waterfalls , the color- everything falls into place . I 'm a cinematography major and the lens work in this movie is incredible - It reminds you how good an experience a seriously crafted film can be . I 've read reviews that think otherwise and I question whether they actually watched it or just skimmed around looking for explosions and war battles . Those who are n't effected are most likely bored with its maturity . DeNiro is a swordsman , Irons is a priest , they both live in a brutal time . Check it out , it will remind you how movies should be made .
