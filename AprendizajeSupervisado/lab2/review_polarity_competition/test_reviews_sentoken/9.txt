I was in the mood for a little Lifetime movie last night and this was on . My advice for anyone in that boat : Do n't waste your time on this one . It is a stinker . Lindsay Lohan used to be a cute , kind of fun actress in her younger days , and from watching this , I ca n't even imagine what 's happened to her . This is one ugly film . It does n't make any sense , the acting and writing is drivel at best , the movie is really dark and disgusting with very little redemptive value as to the time spent watching it . I admit , I did n't finish watching it , but I am so glad I had better judgement and turned it off-I watched enough to realize that this movie is just a gross , bad way to spend any amount of time . Some Lifetime movies are mindless entertainment to while a way an hour or two in bliss while eating a few snacks and having tea or whatever , but this one should be avoided as being one of the stupidest movies made-even for the Lifetime network 's standard of movies .
