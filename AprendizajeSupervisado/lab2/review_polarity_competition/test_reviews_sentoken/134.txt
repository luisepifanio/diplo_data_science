Let me say first -- U can get the complete miniseries of `` MOSES THE LAWGIVER '' . I playing it in my dvd player as I 'm writing this . I always wanted that and wondered how I could get that . They have it in Europe but not here in America . and the reason is , they have the miniseries in PAL format and the edited in america 's format . so I went ahead and order the edited one . and before it came , I found out that if you have the right dvd player u can play Europe movies . Then I went ahead and ordered a dvd player that plays both PAL and NTSC formats . Then ordered the miniseries from Amazon in Europe . AND IT 'S MUCH BETTER ! ! ! !
