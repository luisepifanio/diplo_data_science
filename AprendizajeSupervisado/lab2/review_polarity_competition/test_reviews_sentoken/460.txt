I have Both DD Dvd Movies , The Original Double disc and the Director 's cut . Garner is very Beautiful and as Electra very good , While Michael Clarke Duncan did a great job as Kingpin , It would have been better had it been true to the comic book . Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil . and Collin Farrell As `` Bullseye '' is really good too . The Director 's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot . Both versions are good . Buy both .
