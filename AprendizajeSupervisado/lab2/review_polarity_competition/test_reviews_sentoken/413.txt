... but they damn well ought to have prevented Terry Jones from hacking a fine film to pieces and repackaging it as a `` director 's cut '' .The original 104-minute 'Erik ' featured an impressive cast of solid actors and a surprisingly weighty story with plenty of laughs to keep things moving . Together with his son Bill , Jones has shortened scenes , limited our access to those fine performances , altered the running order of the film , botched the soundtrack ( in several sections entire conversations have been removed , leaving characters ' mouths moving with no sound at all coming from them ) , removed some of the better jokes , and on the whole pared down the film to 79 minutes.You read me right - fully 25 % of the film was chucked to the cutting-room floor for no good reason whatsoever.The real catastrophe of this cut - aside of the shameless rape of one of my favorite childhood movies - is that there was no raw footage from which to assemble a new version . The Joneses had only a print of the original theatrical release to work with , thus they were only able to take parts out and shuffle them around rather than adding anything new . The result is that the entire first act is a chaotic muddle , the second act in Hy-Brasil feels overlong , and the Asgard sequence is a horribly rushed anticlimax with none of the impact of the original scene.I 'm completely mystified as to why this cut was made in the first place ( let alone a cut by such an incredibly untalented editor as Jones ) , but I could accept it if they 'd packaged the original version of the film with it . Inexplicably , they did n't - and it 's not like they were hurting for space on this DVD . Do n't buy it , do n't buy it , do n't buy it .
