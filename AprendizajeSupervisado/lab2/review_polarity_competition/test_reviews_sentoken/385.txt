In true-to-form Kubrick fashion , here is another graphic , disturbing and wholly controversial film.Think of Vietnam movies , and it 's a near certainty that Apocolypse Now , The Deer Hunter , Platoon and Full Metal Jacket will spring to mind.Set in two episodes , one in a Texas boot camp , the other in Vietnam the film has little actual plot . It could certainly be argued that the film is disjointed , almost directed on the spot . However , it 's compelling.Overall , it 's a true depiction of the depravities of war . Whilst not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan , it 's bizarre camera angles , unrestrained violence and gore combined with plenty of black humour serves as an intense thought provoker . This film is one which seems to question the very nature of United States involvement within Vietnam .
