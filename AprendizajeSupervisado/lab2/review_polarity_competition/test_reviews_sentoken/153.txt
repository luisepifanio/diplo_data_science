The movie was nothing short of horrible ! Having read all of the books and being a huge fan of the Chronicles , this movie just annoyed me . I swear to you , if it had a plot I need some help finding it ! This movie demonstrates what Hollywood usually does , turns a great novel into a gothic-gore-fest . I mean it reached a point where they were just taking a woman 's work , her life 's devotion , and destroying it under the guise of her characters ! And to the person who mentioned Armand - boy do I know where you 're coming from ( same thing with Lestat ) . I will say this , I actually thought that Aaliah did a good job with the script she was given . She was very convincing as the character the producers created . Interview with the Vampire was a great film that did justice to Anne Rice 's work . The entire cast ( especially Cruise , Pitt , and Dunst ) was terrific . With that being said , here 's something I found hilarious - apparently the main producer of Queen of the Damned wishes that he had been given the opportunity to work on 'Interview ! ' Apparently the film did n't live up to his expectations and he could of done so much more with it . I think I speak for most people when I say that I 'm glad that he was kept the hell of way from that film . At least there is one movie that Anne Rice fans can admire .
