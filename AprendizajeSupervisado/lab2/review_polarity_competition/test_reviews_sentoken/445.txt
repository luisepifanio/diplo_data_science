If you are like me and grew up watching the Nelsons on TV then you just have to get this DVD . This DVD is great ... ... . The picture quality is superb and the sound is crystal clear ... ... What a great trip down memory lane and a nice visit with the Nelson family . I would have paid ten times as much to get this treasure.As a kid , I had two favourite singers ... . Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson . Actually , nothing has changed , they are still my two favourite singers . Until this DVD , it was hard to find vintage Rick Nelson video and I had to be content with audio Cds.Over the years I have bought Rick Nelson records , 8 tracks , cassettes , and now Cds and this DVD . My favourite music memories are , as a child , watching and listening to Ricky Nelson on TV and Radio and recently , as an adult , I think one of my best memories was cruising with my kids in my 63 T-Bird while we were listening to Ricky.Well , I am rambling on here , ... ... ... ... .. Just get the DVD and have some fun.Mike
