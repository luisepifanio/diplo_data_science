Besides the fact that this movie production is one of my all time favorites , this Blu-Ray release makes it even better . Very crisp images and excellent sound track . If you really enjoyed the movie , you are really going to enjoy this Blu-Ray release . It also has 'Making of ' specials that are not found on previous releases . It plays on my Regional 1 , Panasonic BD10A , Blue-Ray with no problems at all . Enjoy . : - )
