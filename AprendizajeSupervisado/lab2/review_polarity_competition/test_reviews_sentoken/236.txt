Christian Slater , Stephen Dorff , and Tara Reid star in this mess of a film that starts off with an eye-chart explaining the parts of the movie that they did'nt have enough cash to film . I guess the young , male targets of this `` film '' were supposed to see Tara Reid in a skimpy outfit , go `` ooooh.. '' and not laugh at her awful acting and the stupid script.Slater need a new agent , he is in yet another dog of a film - he is a fairly good actor who can do alot of the physical stuff required for this movie in a convincing manner.Halfway through all the explosions and carnage I started looking at my watch - `` GAME OVER '' ! The saddest thing about this debacle is that this movie had alot of potential to be good . Bottom Line : Lions Gate needs to stick to doing `` direct to video only '' films ; they do n't have the chops to make good major screen releases .
