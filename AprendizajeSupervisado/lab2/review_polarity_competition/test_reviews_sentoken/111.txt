If this film is not already a Christmas classic , it will certainly be in that group a few years down the road . Aside from the & quot ; Vacation & quot ; series , this movie stands on its own legs as a hilarious look into the life of Clark W. Griswold , trying to give his family the great American Christmas.There are very few slow moments in the film , which contributes to the fact that you can watch it over and over and over again , not getting sick of it ( remember - a classic ) . It is also filled with countless memorable moments and one-liners , almost on par with & quot ; Caddyshack & quot ; .This film succeeds on two levels of comedy . The first is that it manages to place its characters in funny *situations* as opposed to simply having them try to speak funny lines . This is the mark of a lasting movie . The second level of success is in the humor itself ( the dialogue , the one-liners , etc. ) . It has what it takes to be a classic.All in all , this is one that you buy . You 'll throw it in again and again starting around mid-november , and it will soon become part of your Christmas tradition .
