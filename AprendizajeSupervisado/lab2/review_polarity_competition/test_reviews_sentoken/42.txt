`` Get Carter '' is one of the original , and definitely one of the best , modern gangster films . There would be no `` The Long Good Friday '' , `` Lock , Stock & Two Smoking Barrels '' or `` Snatch '' without this movie . Michael Caine as Jack Carter is the first bad guy in film history that you want to root for , but feel bad because he 's such an evil person . The dialogue is razor-sharp , the sets and cinematography are as dreary as the Northern England location , and the last 30 minutes of the movie , especially the ending , will leave you with the need to stand in the sun for a long time . You 'll understand why after you watch it . And , most importantly , AVOID THE REMAKE AT ALL COSTS !
