We all have heard of the so called & quot ; unplugged & quot ; performances from Clapton to Rod Stewart , but nobody warned me about this DVD . It should have been titled & quot ; Eric Burdon Unplugged & quot ; . His mike is either unplugged or more likely , a software glich occurred in the audio . I called 800-356-0944 ext . 146 to complain but the group that released this dvd was unaware of the problem . If you have the same problem , call this number and they may have an explanation . The dvd continues to be for sale at major retailers .
