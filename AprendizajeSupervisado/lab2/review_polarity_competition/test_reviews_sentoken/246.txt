`` People used to have them all the time , what happened to our generation ? I 'll tell you what happened ... AIDS . '' A close group of 30 something year old friends who have been friends since high school find out that their party house is being sold they try to come up with one last blowout party . After a few suggestions they decide on the most extreme one yet ... an orgy . This is a movie that I think will only do well be word of mouth from the brave people who watch it first . I really loved this movie and laughed the entire way through . I think that the biggest problem this movie has is the title . If it was called The Last Party , or Growing Up or even Friends Forever I think it would have done better because most people are either too offended or uptight to see a movie with this title . I will say there is quite a bit of nudity and sex in this , but nothing outrageous and a little more then `` Hall Pass '' or the `` Change-up '' ( which is the same type of comedy this is ) . Do n't be afraid of the title or embarrassed to watch it , this is a very very funny movie . Overall , a very surprisingly sweet and funny comedy that fans of `` Change-Up '' will love . I loved it . I give it an A- .
