This film continues to mesmerize no matter how many times you watch it . From its magnificent use of color to its breathtakingly haunting soundtrack it is a triumph . Peter Weir was a nobody in America when he made this film . The film boasts only Rachel Roberts as a known entity and yet each performance is a jewel . Like & quot ; Dead Poets Society & quot ; and & quot ; Gallipoli & quot ; , this cast is filled with beautiful sensitive young actors . Sadly , the youthful members of this cast did not go on to achieve the notoriety of Ethan Hawkes or Mel Gibson , but they are indelibly captured for all time like a fine sepia tone photograph you might find in your grandmother 's attic . Like those slightly worn photos , this is a hidden treasure that should see the light of day more often . Another note : I paid a LOT more when I bought this video and it was worth every penny .
