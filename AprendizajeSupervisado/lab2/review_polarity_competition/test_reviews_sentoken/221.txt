Lush production value encompasses this flawless film based on the classic Jane Austen novel . Emma Thompson is triumphant both as the title character and as a screenwriter . Her adaptation is beautifully written and loaded with emotional subtleties , as is her performance . Kate Winslet plays her sister in the film , a perfect foil of unrepressed passion to her sister 's reserved depth of character . The entire cast is magnificent , for that matter . There are so many different characters entering and exiting the story that there is never any threat of boredom for lack of interesting people . The story itself is actually fairly simple , but it is the people who inhabit this fascinating time and place who both complicate and enhance everything around them . The cinematography is sumptuous , with deep greens and glowing sunshine , misty grays and extravagantly colorful indoor settings . The costumes are gloriously adorned and appropriately designed for the era . The look of this film is fantastic ! Then there is director Ang Lee , better known today for his stellar work on `` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . '' His previous film , `` Eat Drink Man Woman , '' more than hinted at his prowess as a possible international success with `` Sense and Sensibility . '' His work here is outstanding . This film was nominated for 7 Oscars , winning only for Best Adapted Screenplay going to Emma Thompson . Another movie entitled `` Braveheart '' won Best Picture that year . Other films along similar lines as `` Sense and Sensibility '' that I recommend highly are `` Howard 's End , '' in which Emma Thompson won the Best Actress Oscar but which is inexplicably not available on DVD , and an eccentric gem called `` Impromptu , '' in which she has a smaller role within yet another exceptional cast of actors . Both films are very European , in the best sense of the word . Highly recommended .
