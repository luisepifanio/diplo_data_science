Ike : Countdown to D-Day is a well-acted , well-written WWII film , that chronicles the 90 days prior to the D-Day invasion . Absent are the bloody battle scenes from Saving Private Ryan and Flags of Our Fathers , replaced by a blow-by-blow account of the planning and organizing that went into Operation Overlord . Tom Selleck delivers a masterful performance as Eisenhower , clearly showing the stress and strain that came with such a huge undertaking . The responsibility of Supreme Commander seems to come easy to Ike on the surface , but under that calm visage Eisenhower wrestles with the issues facing the Allies from both Nazi Germany , and his own command structure . Juggling huge egos and heavy decisions takes its toll on the general , but his leadership is eventually vindicated by the success of the D-Day invasion.Any fan of World War II films should see this movie . It is an excellent addition to the WWII/war film genre .
