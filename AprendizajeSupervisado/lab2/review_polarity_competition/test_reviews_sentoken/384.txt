This is a story about a girl in an isolated community trying to find her identity in the shadow of her beautiful and much-loved sister . It was a good thing that I had read the book first because the movie looses much of the story , including the problems with the relationships between Sara Louise , the captain , and her sister . The movie , as usual , changes quite a few important parts of the story , making it a superficial production . My recommendation - read the book first then get the movie from the local library , do n't spend money renting it .
