How many ways can we re-package and sell the same terrible prints and insipid soundtracks ? Well , the great rip-off continues . These are early Chaplin films taken from lousy prints and with random awful soundtracks added on . This is cheap for a reason . Unfortunately , all the dvds of the Keystone films use the same crummy sources for the films , so until somebody gets off their duff and restores these fine films , we have to deal with this . But we do n't have to like it ! ! Do n't buy these dvds . Do n't encourage these guys .
