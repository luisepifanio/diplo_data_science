Quite a letdown from the first . The characters became less sympathetic . Depp 's character acts like a classic sociopath : say and do anything to further your own goals , regardless of how it harms others . Knightley 's character is not far behind . Bloom 's character remains rather noble , but his nobility blinds him to how others use him , making him appear stupid . The sound track was harder to hear than most other DVDs on our system , so I missed about half of the dialogue . No problem : the plot was predictable . The characters on the whole were flat and stereotypical ( dull ) . The producers seemed to know this , trying to cover it with a plethora of special effects . The third installation may prove some of this analysis wrong , but the protaganists are going to need to really make an effort to become sympathetic and/or well-intentioned . Otherwise , it 's just Seinfeld meets Long John Silver .
