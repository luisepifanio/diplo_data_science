This review is really a companion review to the box set of Original Crew movies.This is the crowning compliment to that set and I would n't be surprised down the road to see this movie bundled with the others ... it 's a natural.This new release of Generations , like the original crew set , comes in two discs , loaded with extras and in its ' glorious widescreen format.Generations , in case you did n't know by now , is a transitional movie.That is the Trek & quot ; torch & quot ; gets passed from the original crew onto the & quot ; Next Generation & quot ; from the TV series of the same name.As I 'm NOT a big Next Gen fan my perspective comes from being a fan of the original series and its ' crew and this movie did n't disappoint.The movie while a very good Trek movie in plot structure and acting shines best when ( and my bias may be showing just a little here ) the original crew is on the screen.The opening of the movie is as exciting as any movie gets with Kirks ' death/disappearance.When next we meet Kirk he and Picard have joined forces to defeat a common foe and to me William Shatner totally steals the show away from Patrick Stewart in their scenes together.And I STILL have trouble & quot ; keeping it together & quot ; when Capt.Kirk dies.But it is not only just Kirks ' death that bothers me but what it signifies ; the end of a long and wondrous journey with the original crew characters from TV to the movies and in reality going from a cancelled TV show and its'struggle and success on finally getting to movies ... .. and seven at that ! A very poignant moment indeed.So , if you 're an original series fan like me and want the perfect companion piece to all of the original crew movies then this two disc special re-release is for you .
