This film , when made , was far ahead of its time . Superb performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones leave you on the edge of your seat in an entirely credible story line with a cast of supporting characters second to none . This film is packed with suspense , drama , incredible surprises and a climatic , emotional ending . No wonder it was nominated for over half a dozen Academy Awards.The DVD quality was virtually flawless , but for one isolated instance that seemed a one second overlap in splicing which , for a 17-year-old film , is entirely inconsequential . Somehow without the use of special effects and modern CGI , the director and all his technicians created exceptionally brilliant scenes that seemed entirely real and vivid . Especially dramatic was the train wrech , Kimbal 's jump off of the dam and the fight scenes on the top of the hotel where the medical conference was being held . You could almost feel yourself there experiencing everything live .
