My rating is not for the movie ( which I like very much ***** ) , but for the lack of HD quality . Although I was very much looking forward to watching this movie in the upgraded Blu-ray format , I was extremely disappointed in the picture quality . This Blu-ray version is extremely soft and overly bright , and lacks HD image depth throughout . Bottom line - because there is no noticeable upgrade in picture quality , if you already own MGM 's 2007 release on DVD there is no need to purchase this Blu-ray version . Let 's hope Citizen Kane & Magnificent Ambersons Blu-ray releases will be better !
