I initally purchased the sampler , with all 9 scenes played for a few minutes . Then I proceed to purchase this set of 9 disc . Alas , whether you like the content is a personal matter , but each disc is only 20 minutes long ! ! ! no where in the description indicate such short play-time , I kept popping disc in & out all the time . I am quite sure a disc can have bigger memory capacity than that .
