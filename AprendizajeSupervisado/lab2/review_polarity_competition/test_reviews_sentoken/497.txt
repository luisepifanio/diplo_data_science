This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible , the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable , and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy . First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback . No story what so ever . The car chase scene is so full of it , a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around . Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out . Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ... .
