I associate the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders with dynamic , fun dance routines , so I expected more from this workout . However , it 's really just a lot of walking in place , on your tiptoes and stepping side-to-side . I think it was made REALLY tedious by the fact that you repeated these moves as if they were really complicated . I guess they wanted to make the routines accessible to the masses , but it does not provide enough challenge for an adequate workout . My heartrate barely elevated , if at all . This routine would get boring very quickly , as there is no room to grow . Even the most rhythm challenged individual would be able to pick up the steps the first time they tried the DVD.One of the few positives is that the dancers leading the workout have vibrant personalities , but it is not enough to sell me on this workout.The DVD is 36 minutes long , and the dance routine is divided into 4-5 min sections led by the different cheerleaders . The music in the routine is a very nondescript , and the moves do n't coincide with the beat at all . If they decide to make another dance workout DVD , I would recommend that they include more complicated dance moves and better music . I just can not recommend this very boring DVD . If you are looking a fabulous dance workout DVD , try Dance off the Inches : Hip Hop Party or Lindsay Brin 's Dance Jam ( which is also by NFL cheerleaders , but includes much better dance moves ) .
