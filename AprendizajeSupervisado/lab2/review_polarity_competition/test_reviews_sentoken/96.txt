I purchased this DVD with great anticipation . I really looked forward to new scenes ( which I thought were cut from the original move , not added at a later date ) . While the new scenes at the beginning helped to explain the beginning of the movie , it did n't make up for the footage cut . After viewing the entire movie , I was absolutely devastated that I had wasted my money on this assault on one of my favorite movies of all times . The new score also grated on me after about 5 minutes . I will be giving away this [ DVD ] as soon as possible . I appreciate the recommendations about the Elite edition - I think I 'll check that out . Thanks .
