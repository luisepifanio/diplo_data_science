I recenty viewed this film , and the entire time I was waiting for something realistic to happen . John Denver is sadly portrayed as a whimpy fool , with no strength , brains , passion for nature or writting , and no integrity.I Think this film should have been called Annie 's story , as Annie is shown as the strength behind , and dominator of his life . Not suprizing , considering the film was made after his death , and she was the chief consaultant . The film serves as a mockery of john Denver under the disguise of a dramatized biogaraphy.To sum the film up it was poorly casted , poorly directed , presumptuous , and produced in the style of a Lifetime original movie . It might be good for a some laughs at John 's expense , if you do n't mind throwing away some money .
