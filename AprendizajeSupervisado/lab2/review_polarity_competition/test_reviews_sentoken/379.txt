Like many people I have seen MOULIN ROUGE , and was thus interested in seeing the first film in Baz Luhrmann 's trilogy , STRICTLY BALLROOM . While it 's not quite as exciting or sensual as MOULIN ROUGE , it is very entertaining.While the storyline is predictable , the actors ' performances are authentic and compelling , especially the relationship between Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice . They have real on-screen chemistry : there is a believable sense of romantic and sexual tension that fuels their desire to win the Pan-Pacific Dance Championship.Obviously Baz Luhrmann loves using lots of saturated color and exaggerated but authentic costumes to bring the world of ballroom dancing to life for those of us unfamiliar with its rituals and triumphs . The dance sequences have to be seen : they are nothing less than incredible ! The interactions between the characters is often outright hilarious , and at times poignant . A very enjoyable and touching story -- like a fairy tale infused with lots of energy and zest for living . WONDERFUL ! ! !
