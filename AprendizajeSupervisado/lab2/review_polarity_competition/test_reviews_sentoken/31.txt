When Wilson ( Terence Stamp ) , a hard-edged working-class ex-con , gets off the flight from London to Los Angeles , you know that whoever he 's looking for is going to have a tough time . Wilson is after whoever was responsible for the death of his daughter . He goes through people relentlessly and remorselessly until he finally deals with a record producer and drug dealer named Terry Valentine ( Peter Fonda ) and Valentine 's hired protector and partner , Jim Avery ( Barry Newman ) . Along the way he picks up a helper ( Luiz Guzman ) and meets a retired actress ( Lesley Ann Warren ) who makes him look at himself a little , but not for long.This is a first-class movie of revenge and retribution , with smart , sharp dialogue , efficient direction and terrific performances all around , especially by Stamp . He plays an aging professional criminal , tough as they come . Stamp at 60 nails the part . There 's not an ounce of fat on the guy . His eyes stare coldly . When a big , muscular thug tries to eject him from a party at the hillside home of Valentine , Wilson tosses him off the cantilevered pool to his death . When several thugs rough him up in a warehouse , make fun of his age and toss him out into the parking lot , he gets up , walks to his car , takes up a gun and walks right back . Several of the thugs get hurt.Fonda also is very good . He plays Valentine as an amoral , self-delusional Hollywood player who is greedy and spineless . Newman is Fonda 's muscle , and Newman comes across as almost as tough as Stamp.An amusing touch is a couple of flashbacks Wilson has , thinking of his daughter when she was a baby and he was with the mother . The flashbacks are taken from a movie Stamp made in 1967 . This is typical of the clever directing of Soderbergh . He has produced a movie which I hope wo n't be forgotten.The Limey , in my view , is a keeper.The DVD looks just fine
