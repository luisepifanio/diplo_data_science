Do n't buy this movie thinking that it will be some real thriller with a lot of blood and guts . It was released by Pulsepounders , a Canadian film company which produces family film horror . Thouroughly entrenched in the PG range , this is more Goosebumps than Scream and that 's a good thing for parents with kids into the horror genre.A teenage boy uses his wits and the support of his family to save his town from a coven of Vampires . The special effects are n't great , the costumes are n't either , but it serves its purpose of edge-of-the-seat , while at the same time still safe , entertainment a parent can safely let their child watch without worrying it will warp them .
