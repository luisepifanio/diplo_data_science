I WAS BUMBED THAT THE DVD HAD CUT OUT ABOUT THE LAST 15 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE , THE PART OF THE FILM WHHERE HE LEAVES THE COTTAGE WAVING TO HIS WIFE AND THEN DIPES THE WING OF HIS 109 OVER THE COTTAGE AND HEADS OUT OVER THE NORTH SEA NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN . I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST HUMAN AND EMOTIONAL PART OF THE FILMJIMMY C .
