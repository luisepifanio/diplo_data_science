The STORY makes this film worth seeing for ANYONE.This film also provides all SORTS of insight , but not through any didactic teaching . Instead that story , of a young woman with a mental illness and her relationship with folks in a church , leads us . It was only as I reflected on the experience of the film that I realized how much information it really contained.The links between homelessness and mental illness are strong . My research is into food and housing for the homeless and barely sheltered , so I encounter this topic every day in my work , but no matter how many times I try to EXPLAIN the links , I usually fail to make sense of this topic for my listeners . I think I 'll just give it up and show this film instead.But an equally compelling , and lovely , aspect of this work is the depiction of one community 's ( in this case a Catholic church 's ) sensitive , pervasive , and deeply good engagement with the woman they found literally on their doorstep.The film walks a fine line , allowing us to sense the emotions of her family and of those who cared for her , but avoiding sentimentality.Occasionally there 's a bit much talking head , reading , and streetscape , but these are most likely evidence of a narrow budget , because overall , the cinemetography and editing are both very well done . The film never lags.My only major quibble is with the ending , which I wo n't spoil for you . It pushes somewhat too far in suggesting a particular explanation . Another explanation serves equally well , one which includes the fact that Ms. Wiltsee 's diet would unquestionably have weakened her bones . This explanation , however , would be less comforting than the one offered . Perhaps that 's OK , under the circumstances.Overall , entirely worth watching . Lovely , really , in every aspect .
