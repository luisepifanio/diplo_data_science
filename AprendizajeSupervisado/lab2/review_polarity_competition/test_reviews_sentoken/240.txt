Brace yourself - intelligent sci-fi is n't dead , nor is it an oxymoron . You would n't have known that for several years , with dull releases such as Alien : Resurrection , Battlefield Earth , the new Star Wars travesties , Chronicles of Riddick , and Starship Troopers littering the sci-fi landscape with one dreadful bomb after another . Minority Report breaks that chain , and shows Steven Speilberg in top form once again.Of course it 's Spielberg - who else is out there to bring 5 start science-fiction to the screen ? This is the man that brought us E.T . over 20 years ago , also regarded as one of the greatest sci-fi movies in history . When he chooses to , Spielberg delivers movies with carefully crafted stories , fully developed characters that draw us in and that we care about , realistic scripts , and of course special-effects that support the film rather than stand center-stage as the main focus . This film is not only no exception , it raises Spielberg 's bar.Tom Cruise is well cast in his role as the cop at the center of the film , but the supporting cast is where the excellence truly lies . Max Von Sydow plays his role to perfection and never lets you really know , until the end , where his loyalties lie . Colin Farrell , playing Cruise 's foil , is more than just Hollywood 's new pretty boy here - this film gives him real meat to work with and act with . And he 's really good at it.This film exemplifies what science fiction film should be . Beyond eye-candy with too many special effect , sci-fi should be a reflection of our present condition and present day life , and should provoke us to think about ourselves , or our society , or our condition . This film does so and lends itself to multiple viewings , each time giving us something new to see or think about.I can not recommend this film too many times . Easily one of the ten best science fiction films in history .
