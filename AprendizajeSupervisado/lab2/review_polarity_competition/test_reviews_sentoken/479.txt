Fans of the novel ( like me ) will cringe at how the vital character of Senator Orrin Knox is reduced to a minor figure ( and played by the relatively obscure Edward Andrews as a buffoon ) who disappears halfway through the film , but for the most part this is an excellent political film with magnificent performances by Pidgeon , Murray , and especially Laughton in his last role as Senator Seab Cooley who leads the opposition against a liberal nominee for Secretary of State . It 's ironic that Laughton would be playing a character with such a grudge against Henry Fonda since the two also despised each other in real life ( stemming from a bad experience when Laughton had directed Fonda in & quot ; The Caine Mutiny Court Martial & quot ; on Broadway ) . Watch for TV legend Betty White in a bit part as a feisty Kansas senator .
