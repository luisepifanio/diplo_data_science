There must be two versions of this dvd . I ordered one from an Amazon Marketplace seller that was supposed to be this version . However , they sent me a version by WHAM ! USA . This version has terrible quality . The advertisement for this dvd says it is 150 minutes in length . But the WHAM ! USA version is 113 minutes in length . Plus , the dvd cover is different from the one in the Amazon ad . I have n't seen the 150 minute version , but run far away from this version .
