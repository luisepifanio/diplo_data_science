Please save your money . This DVD is one of the worst tape to DVD transfers I have ever seen . The contrast is bad and there is a yellowish green color cast through the entire movie.If you buy this to see Laura Gemser , you will be disappointed . She is not in the movie as much as you might think.Please avoid this poor quality DVD . I would have given it ZERO STARS if Amazon 's rating system allowed that .
