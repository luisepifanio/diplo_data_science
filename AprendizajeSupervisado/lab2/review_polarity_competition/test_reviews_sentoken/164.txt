Wonderful book , a good made for tv mini-series , a badly made blu-ray . The nighttime shots have so much video noise in them that those scenes make the blu-ray nearly unwatchable at times . There was also quite a bit of edge blurriness which completely takes away from the beautiful vistas and grand landscapes . Truly a shame that the company made such a poor transfer and did n't bother cleaning up the material afterwords . Wait until they re-release it if you care at all how the transfer looks .
