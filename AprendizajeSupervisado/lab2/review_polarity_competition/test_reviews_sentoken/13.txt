Troma makes great movies . However they also usually buy and distribute crap . This is another one of those.I really did n't like Joel Reed 's `` Bloodsucking Freaks '' much . It was hyped to be so extreme and really was n't . It also did n't have much comedy.Well , G.I . Executioner is far tamed from that . It 's a long line of terrible dialogue and the only selling point is nudity . I guess a girl shooting a gun while in the nude and being killed landing in a big net and hanging in the net nude is supposed to be the entertainment highlight of this film .
