Kooky fun - I 'm sure considered scandalous and decadent upon first release but now a kooky time capsule glimpse at what was considered shocking and depraved 40+ years ago . It is a much more realistic look at teens on break than the `` beach '' movies from the US starring Frankie Avalon . Keep in mind this is the EXACT SAME movie as SWEET VIOLENCE . Difference is SWEET ECSTASY is dubbed with a soft , 4:3 and haggard print while SWEET VIOLENCE is subtitled , widescreen and a pristine print . So , most film fanatics will prefer the SWEET VIOLENCE 's transfer to DVD even though it 's in French .
