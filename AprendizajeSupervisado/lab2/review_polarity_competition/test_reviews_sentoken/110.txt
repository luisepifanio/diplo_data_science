This movie is worse than the original Sabertooth . The plot is worse , the acting is worse , but the sabertooths look better . The titular creatures actually look pretty good for a Sci-fi original . But sadly , the creature does n't appear all too often . Sometimes , the creature goes unnoticed for half an hour . But , for the plot , a mogul creates three sabertooths and makes an island attraction . But when customers arrive , the sabertooths escape ! Sound familiar ? Sometimes Attack of the Sabertooth forgets that its not Jurassic Park . But , Sabertooth does n't pay homage to Jurassic Park , it just shames it . This movie is full of stupid scenes like the opening . A gurad is reading porn , but the wind whisks the magazine into the sabertooth cage . The guard somehow think risking life and limb is worth getting the porn , so he enters the cage . Of course the sabertooth eats him . But could n't the writer find a better way to off the first guy ? Or is the movie trying tyo make an anti-porn statement ? No , this movie is far too stupid to make a statement of any kind . This movie snags 2 stars for its cool sabertooths .
