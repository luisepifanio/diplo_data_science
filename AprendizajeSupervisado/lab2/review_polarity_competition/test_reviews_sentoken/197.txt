1st let me say the 1st movies them selves are fantastic , but not on this horrible set where sullivan entertainment has lied to us all , they say this is widescreen from the original 35mm , BS , all they did was take the original 4x3 from the 1st 2 movies zoomed up and cropped the top and bottom , I have the remastered set from 2008 and its soooo much better , this one is soft , bad color and your missing a good 25 % of the viewing as they cropped it off , how do I know this a scene with matthew has him reading the farmers almanac where you can actually read the name in the 4x3 original version same scene in this so called remastered version that book is cut off , if this was really shot in 16x9 35mm widescreen not only would you see all the picture from the original 4x3 but also an extra 25 % on each side where if originally shot in 16x9 then pan and scan for 4x3 TV would have cut off the side , but no back in 1986 and 1988 when this was shot he had no idea of going beyond TV so it was shot like every other TV movie or mini series back then in 4x3 , but to lie about it , never by from these scums again , now the last 2 movies since they were much newer was originally shot in 16x9 and the do benefit from the remaster , but to dupe the public into thinking your getting something more with this so called remastered versions of movies 1 and 2 , when your actually getting less than you had in the 4x3 versions , pitiful .
