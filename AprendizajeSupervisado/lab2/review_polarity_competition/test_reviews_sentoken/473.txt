This is one of my favorite movies . Michael J . Fox plays Marty McFly , who accidentally gets sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a time machine that also happens to be a DeLorean automobile . The problem is to get enough of an electrical charge to get back to 1985 , while leaving 1955 as it was . In the process , Marty meets his parents , jeopardizes their relationship , and risks his own existance . Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play , but there are other great performances here , as well . Christopher Lloyd is excellent as & quot ; Doc & quot ; Brown , and Lea Thompson , Crispin Glover , and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie . There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950 's , and some of the gags based on Fox 's out-of-time character are classic . Check out Marty playing & quot ; Johnnie B. Goode & quot ; as a bandmember holds up the phone so his & quot ; cousin & quot ; , Chuck Berry , can listen and learn . This is not the cleverest or most sophisticated comedy around , but it is definitely great fun . I 've watched it many times and expect to watch it many more . If you have n't got a copy , try to pick one up . You wo n't be sorry .
