On first glance , this 4 1/2 hour series is about Civil War battlefields . When you watch it though , you discover that the company recycles the same blurred out & quot ; artsy & quot ; video clips in every single video and throws in choppy simulations of silent films that , upon first glance , appear to be scenes from & quot ; Birth of a Nation. & quot ; They are n't . It is just as well that it 's blurred because it covers up some of the defects of this low scale fiasco . The company is based in Eugene , Oregon , and it seems doubtful that they ever left that state even to take reenactment footage . A blurred out clip of Burnsides Bridge was used for both Manassas , Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg . I was expecting an in depth discussion of each battlefield with full colored realistic reenactment footage . If you are looking for quality and scholarship , you wo n't find it in this one .
