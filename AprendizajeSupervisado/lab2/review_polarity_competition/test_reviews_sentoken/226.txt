Eighteen years after its release , When Harry Met Sally remains the standard -- the romantic comedy against which all others are measured ( and often fail ) . Like so many other people , I loved it instantly when I saw it in a theater , and after so many romances , stories , break-ups , and life , it still feels to me as true as it did then . The chemistry between Ryan and Crystal is great . She is gorgeous and charming ; he makes pessimism and neurosis funny . Witty , delightful , romantic -- thank you , Ms. Ephron and Mr. Reiner for giving us this wonderful movie .
