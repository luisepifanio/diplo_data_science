I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it . One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs . Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley 's `` Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast '' . Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use does n't require a video format for effective presentation . The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol ' boys fishing the Carolina Coast -- it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video . Save your money .
