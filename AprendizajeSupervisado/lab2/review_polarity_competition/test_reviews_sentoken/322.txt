After the tragic death of a pop icon , I was skeptical of the motives behind this DVD . Were they squeezing money out of a canceled concert ? Taking advantage of a bad situation ? And would the movie focus on the tragedy , with scant footage of the actual music and dancing ? For these reasons , I had low hopes when my wife talked me into getting this . We both experienced the phenomenon of `` Thriller '' in the early 80s , as teens , but I doubted this could capture that same excitement . `` This is It '' was a wonderful surprise . We get a close up view of the planned tour in its final days of rehearsal . We hear the enthusiasm of the dancers , and marvel at their abilities . All of them , of course , are inspired by Michael himself , and the King of Pop delivers here , showing that he had lost none of his form even in the days before his death . He pops , locks , sings , squeals , with all the energy I remembered . There are a few stumbles , which is why they call it a rehearsal , but overall , I felt I was catching the vibe of the intended show.Not only do we get an intimate look at the rehearsal process , with some incredible effects for `` Thriller '' and others , we hear some of Michael 's creative process . Particularly impressive , in light of today 's tendency toward pretaped sounds and music , the entire show is done with a cast of musicians on stage , producing tight sounds and heart-pounding beats.If you 're looking for insights into Michael Jackson 's death , you 'll find none of that here , but if you 're looking for his passion , imagination , and musical skills , `` This is It .
