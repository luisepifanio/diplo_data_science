If you are looking for a challenge , this is it . She takes you through so many leg squats and lunges that your thighs tremble . 2 hours later , you are still jittery . Its awesome . I have never gotten such a intense leg workout . And us women need that . I always rate the workouts by the soreness the next day . I usually get sore from this one . I try to do it 2 times a week . Even once a week will super charge your metabolism into high gear .
