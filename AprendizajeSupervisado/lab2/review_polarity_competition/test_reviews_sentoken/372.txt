I first saw & quot ; A Place in the Sun & quot ; over forty years ago . Today I never miss it when it 's on television . This movie is just so incredibly beautiful and engrossing . Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor make such a beautiful couple onscreen . And it was so refreshing because I knew that Montgomery Clift loved Liz 's character because she was who she was , not because of her wealth . And the movie had such a sad ending ... oh , I cried so hard . This is a drama that you will fall in love with . They do n't make pictures with this beautiful entertainment anymore ... watching two people fall in love . See the movie 's closeups ... even in black and white , the true love that Clift and Taylor really had for each other breaks through on the screen ... do n't miss this movie . It has earned its place in the sun .
