I chose this Fields title for this review because Amazon seems to be employing it as a business practice . I dearly love the movie of that title and would like to add it to my DVD library . So I entered it into the `` search '' field and clicked on `` go . '' I was delighted ... at first ... to see this collection pop up and I 1-click ordered it immediately . Then I discovered the movie is not included ; the set is merely the same old collection of shorts that have been issued and reissued over and over by other companies . I tried to cancel the order but was informed that it was already being processed and could not be cancelled or changed . It arrived and I returned it immediately.Maybe some day NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK will become available ( hopefully issued in the quality restoration it well deserves ) . But do n't let Amazon sucker you into buying this set if it 's the movie you 're after . We deserve an even break !
