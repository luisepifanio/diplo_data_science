Nice guy Gary ( Lawrence Monoson ) is having trouble getting the attention of the pretty new girl in school ( Diane Franklin ) . Trouble is , she likes his studly friend Rick ( Steve Antin ) , who basically treats her like dirt . Story basically follows Gary and Rick and tubby friend David ( Joe Rubbo ) on their sexual misadventures , which basically gets them nowhere quick . Despite all the sexual innuendo and cruelty in the story , Gary 's teenage angst will surely bring back memories for many male viewers . Great early '80 's soundtrack . In light of & quot ; Porky 's & quot ; and & quot ; Fast Times at Ridgemont High & quot ; and all the other teen genre films of the early '80 's this is an overlooked item , but a good one . Good cast and believeable acting increase the appeal here .
