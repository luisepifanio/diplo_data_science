Do not buy this . take my advice.1 ) the image is appallingly awful . it is grainy . the color is horrid . all around crap . it would look better on VHS than this garbage.2 ) it is pan and scan . no wide screen . there are parts when two characters are talking and you ca n't even see all of their bodies because of how badly it was cut off.3 ) no matter what DVD player i play it on , throughout the first chapter , i can not seem to get rid or a little `` PLAY '' icon on the top right during playback . it is not my players.4 ) the audio is off everywhere . sometimes you ca n't hear any dialogue.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS . LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE .
