This movie was positively terrible . I am a big Anne Rice , and except for the fact that they were some of the same characters , it had nothing to do with the book . HOW CAN THEY DO THAT ? ? ! ! ! they should have just madea different movie and had some similarities . at least then i would be an alright movie . I HATED THIS MOVIE ! ! ! I am now going to tell you why it is so bad.First of all , Stuart Townsend did play a good Lestat , but first they have to get his story straight . MARIUS DID NOOOOT MAKE HIM ! ! ! Lestat was about a century old before he even met Marius . a renegade vampire name Magnus made Lestat.Next , Akasha is not so powerful that she can be awake during the day . Lestat definitely ca n't . No matter how powerful you are , even if the sun does n't affect you , all vampires sleep in the daytime.And how could they leave out so many characters ? ? Like Lestat 's two fledglings , Gabrielle and Louis ( from Interview with the Vampire ) . How could they leave out Marius ' two fledglings , Armand and Pandora . What about Armand 's fledling , Daniel ? Maharet 's two feldglins Mael and Eric , and by the way , Maharet made Jesse , and before Akasha even came ! ! ! All of these characters were in the book , AND then finally they killed Akasha wrong . Maharet 's twin , Mekare , came and killed her , and ate her heart and brain , making her the new Queen of the Damned . AAAHHH ! ! and then there are numerous other slip-ups ! any anne rice fan , do NOT go to see this . no matter how much you wan na judge it by urself , u will be so irritated . i know that i am ! !
