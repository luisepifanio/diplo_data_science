This movie was bad . It was so bad that it made the good actors in it look bad by proxy . The plot was simplistic , dull and forced . The suspense was found in spots that must have read on the script as & quot ; ( Insert suspense here ) & quot ; . Denzel Washington acted like Denzel washington acting as a cop . The tired 'foil ' detective they tried to use as a red herring was so obvious it was painful to watch . The identity of the serial killer was so pathetic that it made me throw stuff at my TV . The clues left behind by the killer were n't all that subtle , I 've seen smarter clues in Encyclopedia Brown mysteries . It 's a boring predictable hollywood hack job . bad bad bad . Do n't waste your money .
