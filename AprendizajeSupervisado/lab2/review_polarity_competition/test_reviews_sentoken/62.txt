Spurred on by previous experience with 'Bram Stoker 's Dracula ' , we elected to rent this title ( thankfully , we did n't purchase it ) . The most artful aspect of this movie is the cover illustration . The plot was painfully predictable , the acting was soap opera quality ( shallow , transparent characters ) , the special effects were sadly lacking . The complaints that my family continually uttered were the only thing that kept me awake.If you expect a movie similar to the quality of 'Bram Stoker 's Dracula ' - do n't waste your time here . By comparison , 'Army of Darkness ' was a true classic .
