DO NOT buy this if you are a fan of the original US version released in 1990 . The cutting of lines/scenes really retracts from the movie and overall rushes the movie past key character development and plot emphasis . The original was funny , thoughtful and you really got the sense of the camaraderie between the characters and an understanding of why what they were doing was so important/dangerous/exciting.A damn shame really . Maybe in a couple of years they will release the 2-disk collection containing both the DVD version of the original and of this hacked-up tragedy as they did in the UK .
