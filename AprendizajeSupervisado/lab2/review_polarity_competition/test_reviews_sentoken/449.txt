I have just received Nijinsky the dvd transfer . It is not beautifully restored , there is no letterbox , no extras which would have been so interesting . No nothing ! INFURIATING ! Except for Leslie Browne 's pathetic performance , the acting is very fine . Especially interesting is the wonderful Carla Fracci who was not only a great ballerina but a great actress . Even George was good . Beautifully filmed , wonderful , accurate costumes and sets make this a film worth seeing . Sadly , the dance sequences and short and cut . I would have been willing to sit another hour for more , especially the intriguing reconstruction of Jeux . Lets have a dvd with the movie restored to it 's original beauty and LOTS OF EXTRAS ! ! ! ! The VHS copy is horrible .
