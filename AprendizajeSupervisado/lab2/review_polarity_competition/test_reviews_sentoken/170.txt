Jack-O ( Steve Latshaw , 1995 ) Seriously , someone ripped off Pumpkinhead ? Think about the silliness inherent in that concept . And then browse IMDB and find out that Fred Olen Ray was involved . Ah , now suddenly everything makes sense . Ray is a maestro of mediocrity , a Caligari of crap , a sorcerer of ... well , okay , you get the idea . In any case , anecdotal evidence has it that Ray had a couple of unrelated film clips of John Carradine and Cameron Mitchell , and dared screenwriter Brad Linaweaver ( The Brain Leeches ) to come up with a story that used them both . This was the result . Patrick Moran ( Vampire Trailer Park ) was brought in to do a bit of script doctoring , and roped in his pal Steve Latshaw , who 'd also directed VTP . The end result is ... well . Um.So , yeah , sorcerer dies back in the day and curses the town , blah blah blah , then he rises again on Halloween night , having taken on the personality of a much better monster from a much better monster movie , and sets about killing people . ( There 's a weak storyline given as to why he does so , but it is entirely inconsistent with his actions . ) Yeah , that 's basically it.Let 's face it , if you 're watching Jack-O , you 're watching it because you 've heard that both Brinke Stevens and Linnea Quigley are in it . This is true . There are also some other hot horror babes involved ( Helen Keeling [ who has never been seen on screen again , for reasons that will become obvious when you watch the movie ] , Maddisen Krown , Rachel Carter , and a couple of others with bit parts ) . And if that 's enough for you , then by all means , have at it . But be prepared , because this movie is a dog and a half , and the special effects on the half-dog have something to do with strawberry jam . *
