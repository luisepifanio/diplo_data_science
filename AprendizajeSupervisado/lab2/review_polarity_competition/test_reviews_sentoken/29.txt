I just bought this item . This is a great movie itself but whatever cheazyflicks did to it is sad . I ca n't even watch the movie because after 20 minutes the picture gets all disturted and starts pausing and the sound also freezes and is distorted . The movie itself is great buy the VHS version and you 'll be better off .
