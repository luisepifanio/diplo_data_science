I have loved this movie/video ever since I saw it for the first time in the 7th grade in New Jersey . ( thank you Mrs . Watro ! ) . It 's corny but very fun to watch . My favorite song is `` Hey Johnny , Look Smart '' . To add to the trivia about this movie , in an episode of the fine medical drama St . Elsewhere , William Daniels ( Dr. Mark Craig ) & his wife ( played by Bonnie Bartlett ) were in Philadelphia at a medical conference . As they were walking around Liberty Plaza ( I think ! ) she was badgering him to sing something . So finally , he came out with `` it 's hot as hell in Philadelphia ! ! ! '' which , as we know , is from this movie ! Yet another `` John Adams '' reference in his career . I about fell on the floor laughing when I heard that ! Just thought this would be a fun piece of trivia to write about .
