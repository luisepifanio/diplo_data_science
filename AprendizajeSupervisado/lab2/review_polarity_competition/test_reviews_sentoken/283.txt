I do n't get it ... I just read a review that stated that the Original Baby Songs was better than this one . Whoa ... it 's not even close in my opinion . I have the Original Baby Songs , Baby 1-2-3 , and Baby 's Busy Day , and there 's just no comparison in my daughter 's opinion ( and mine as well ) .The tunes are just that much `` catchier '' than the other two . Maybe it 's an age issue ( my daughter is 13 months ) , but she must have my tastes because Baby 's Busy Day is the only one that immediately gets her attention and puts a smile on her face.Until about the age of 1 , she was most interested in the Baby Einstein movies . But as soon as she turned 1 , she got really bored with those . So we bought a 3-pack of Baby Songs and she is hooked . She dances , screams , laughs , and just loves Baby 's Busy Day.I would recommend them all , but without question Baby 's Busy Day is an overall much more fun DVD . It does have some outdated video ( lots of early 80 's shots if I 'm guessing right ) , but it 's more about the music and the children 's interactions than the clothes they wear.My only gripe is that the songs are so catchy that I 've started humming them at work . You should see the looks I get ! Please , if you 're going to try one Baby Songs , make it Baby 's Busy Day ~ you wo n't regret it .
