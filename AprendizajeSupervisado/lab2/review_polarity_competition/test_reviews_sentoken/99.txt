I saw adds for this and was really looking forward to it . Unfortunately was a big disappointment . There was really very little good about this movie . The concept was ok , and could have been a half decent movie with a little work . The locations/sets were n't to bad . But everything else , waste of time and effort . Effects were lame , to the point of blood spraying everywhere was the staple effect . Fight sequences were slow and sloppy . I happened to like Michelle Rodriguez , but even her acting in this was lacking , and that falls at the feet of a bad director.I would recommend waiting till it 's on TV . Or if you ca n't wait that long , 7 day rental at the most .
