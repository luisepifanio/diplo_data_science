Even if you do not like Disney 's post- & quot ; Lion King & quot ; attempts , you still have to give the studio credit for making each movie so diverse from each other . & quot ; The Emperor 's New Groove & quot ; , is without a doubt the most comical of Disney 's movies . Odd thing is , that if you were n't to see the & quot ; Walt Disney Pictures & quot ; intro , you would'nt know it was Disney . This is becuase & quot ; New Groove & quot ; departs in both animation & amp ; story-telling styles that has been Disney 's trademark . This film is narrated by the film 's main character , Emperor Kuzco , and has more of a fast pace Saturday morning cartoon feel to it ( that 's not a bad thing , BTW ) .In the story of trying to destroy the emperor but instead turning him into a Llama , the villains once again steal the show . However , unlike & quot ; Hercules & quot ; , the good guys are characters you like and care about . It 's just that Yzma ( probably the most outragoeus of all the Disney villains ) and Kronk have all the qualities of live action comedian , including timeing and style that makes you want to laugh . Kuzco and Pacha , have funny moments to , but some of them are forced.The DTS 5.1 track on the DVD is awesome , and the digital-to-digital transfer is flawless.It is a whole lot more comedic than & quot ; Aladdin & quot ; , but it 's not the same type of movie . & quot ; Aladdin & quot ; has comedic releif , in an otherwise serious adventure tale . While , & quot ; The Emperor 's New Groove & quot ; has some dramatic relief in an otherwise hysterical adventure tale . Great submission from Disney !
