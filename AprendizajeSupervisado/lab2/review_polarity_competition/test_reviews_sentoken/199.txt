This little known gem has been successfully ignored for too long . I am hopeful the DVD version will finally become available soon.As with all good movies , the promotion and casting are never the real reason fo success as much as whether the story and direction can create a psycological tie to the viewer . This one excelled for me in many ways.The exquisite soundtrack had it all . One of the first to use popular songs from a by-gone era to create a nostalgia , and the haunting `` Elmo 's '' theme that Timothy Hutton develeoped throughout the re-incarnation portion was brought to a head beautifully in the closing scene . I was brought to tears in the reunion ending . It still gives me the chills each time I see it . This Neal Young tune `` We Never Danced '' was treated wonderfully.Another fine aspect of this film that is a mystery is the casting of the character `` Emmett '' . I believe it is Debora Winger , but I could be wrong . I assumed the character to be either Micheal the Arc-Angel or God , but certainly not the devil . He ( or she ? ) is definitely in control of Heaven and souls . Iwas also very delighted to see the vignettes by Tom Petty , Neal Young and Ric Ocasek.I urge everyone to see this when it becomes available .
