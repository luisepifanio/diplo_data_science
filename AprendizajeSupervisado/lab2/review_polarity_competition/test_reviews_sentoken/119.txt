This movie was great in the 80 's and still great now . It takes you back to when `` Kids '' broke it down in the local warehouse club . Bustin ' moves to gain respect , and showing off your `` crew '' . While most kids today hav n't the clue , this was the anti-Brat pack movie . No Molly Ringwold , Anthony Michael Hall , Just `` Ozone '' and `` Turbo '' . To those who know those names live in the movie `` Hall Of Fame '' . Just buy this movie it 's worth the 8 bucks . You 'll watch it on a rainy day , or lazy Sunday with some pop corn . For even more fun invite all the friends from the 80 's pop it on before they come over , and watch the topics of conversation ROLL ! ! ! ! !
