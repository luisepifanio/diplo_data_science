Overall , I like this . Evanescence gave an outstanding performance ( although some songs sounded a little alike ) , and I was surprised at good they sounded live . Also included are the band 's music videos to date , which are worth checking out if you have n't seen them before . The `` insightful '' behind-the-scenes segment offers a personal look at the band , revealing a free-spirited ( although sometimes silly ) side that one would not expect when considering the content of their music.That said , this package is still far from perfect . My cheif complaint was the videography itself . There are lots of unnecessary special effects edited into the performances , and the cameras switch so often and so quickly that it actually makes the show uncomfortable to watch at times . Also , the CD track listing is incorrect , and this could potentially cause some problems when trying to copy songs from the CD.Because of those complaints , I would recommend this primarily for Evanescence fans , especially those who have never seen them play live . For everyone else , I suggest checking out the `` Fallen '' album first .
