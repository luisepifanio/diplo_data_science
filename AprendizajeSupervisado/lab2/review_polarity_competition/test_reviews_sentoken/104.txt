Three separate copies of the DVD version did not work in my player but did work in my PC DVD-rom drive . How disappointing for my five year old who has been looking forward to receiving the movie since we saw it in the theatre . A letter to the Disney store pointed me to Buena Vista technical service but did n't say anything about a known problem with MOST DVD players . Beware consumers ! Unless you have time and/or money to waste you may want to think twice about purchasing this one in DVD .
