I review a lot of movies . Most of them tend to be humdrum . Every once in a rare while you find one with a simple plot , predictable happy ending that makes you feel good inside . Even though you have a pretty good idea of how it will end , we never cease to be amazed by the impact that some movies may have on us . This one presents a strong , loving human side of our nature that rarely surfaces . Kids come pretty close to presenting this higher side of ourselves . Even though this movie is simple . It is one of those movies that that will always make you & quot ; feel good & quot ; inside , and enjoy watching many times over with family and friends . This one is being added to my permanent collection ! ! Bob : - )
