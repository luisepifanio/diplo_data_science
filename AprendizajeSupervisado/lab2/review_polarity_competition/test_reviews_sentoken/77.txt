Mary Poppins must be one of the loveliest filming produced by Disney studios . This musical movie is extremely well produced and has outstanding actor work . The scenes are of high quality despite the whole story was filmed indoors . Even the little part of London was reproduced in Disney studio . The music from Sherman brothers is world famous and well known . When you hear the first tunes , you might say : Hey I 've heard that somewhere ! Having this DVD on your shelf would please both you and your younger fellows .
