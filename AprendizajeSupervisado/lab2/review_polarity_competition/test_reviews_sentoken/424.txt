& quot ; Pandaemonium & quot ; is truly a tribute to two of the great geniuses of English Literature -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth . All aspects combine together to create a masterpiece for all lovers of poetry AND Romantic Poets . I teach English 9-12 and a class on the Romantic Poets so I know my stuff and was completely blown away by the beauty and dedication of the movie . It does n't pull punches with the opium addiction and Coleridge 's usually cold marriage to his wife Sarah . Lord Byron makes a cameo . I was slightly disappointed that there was no room for introducing Asra -- Mary Wordsworth 's sister and Coleridge 's obsession -- but that side story does n't detract from the overall experience . I cried at the end because & quot ; Kubla Khan & quot ; is truly his masterpiece and a beautiful work of literature . I will be showing this movie the first week of school with my Romantic Poet 's class . It 's a must ! I just wish there was something equally brilliant about my true poetic love John Keats !
