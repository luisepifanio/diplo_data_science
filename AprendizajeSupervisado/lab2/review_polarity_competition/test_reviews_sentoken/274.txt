This movie has been called `` Dead Poets Society for girls '' , and while there are strong similarities between these two movies , Mona Lisa Smile stands on its own . Julia Roberts plays Katherine Howard , a `` California bohemian '' who comes to Wellesley College to teach History of Art to a group of ( mostly ) spoiled rich girls who are there just biding their time until they get married . She intends to change this by making them see they can do whatever they want to do with their lives , not just someone 's wives.Of course , trying to change tradition and the College 's establishment does n't come cheaply , as she is seen by her students as someone not worthy ( why is n't she married ? ) and as someone dangerous by the school 's governing body . She does n't follow tradition , does n't obey the rules and has what they call unorthodox ways of teaching , like taking the girls to see modern art and not following the curse 's syllabus.As time passes and the girls get to know her , things start to change , and by the end of the movie everyone has learned a valuable lesson in life.One of the main differences between this movie and Dead Poets Society is that it mainly follows Katherine 's life , leaving the students ' lives as secondary stories , while in DPS it 's the other way around . We do however share some moments with some of the other characters , namely Betty Warren ( Dunst ) , the bratty , spoiled girl who despises Katherine and her ways , Joan Brandwyn ( Stiles ) , who is somewhat torn between life as a housewife and going to Law school , Connie Baker ( Goodwin ) , whose not as beautiful as the other girls and only dreams of finding love , and Giselle Levy ( Gyllenhall ) , the wild , sexy girl . Most of the movie , however , centers on Katherine 's struggles both on and off campus , as she starts a romantic relationship with the school 's Italian teacher ( West ) .Set in the 50 's , this movie deal mainly with the subject of liberation and equality , its message being that women can be all they want to be , not only wives.The acting in the film is solid , starting with Roberts , but the real standouts are the girls . Dunst does mean and bitchy very well , and Stiles gives another good performance , but the two shining characters are Goodwin and Gyllenhall . Marcia Gay Harden , as the repressed Nancy Abbey , the school 's teacher for `` how to behave in society affairs '' and Katherine 's house mate .
