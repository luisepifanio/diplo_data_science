Just when you though Robert Pattinson could only play a vampire , comes a really cute comedy he made right before Twilight . Robert plays a very quirkey character that is having a `` quarter-life '' crisis . Bored with life , girlfriend , job he sets out to find out who he really is and what he really wants to do with his life . Non-supportive parents play a factor in this too . Very well acted on Robert 's part ... he is totally believable.If you like this , you should try to find an earlier piece he did for ITV ( the broadcast channel for England ) -it was called `` Bad Mother 's Handbook '' . I do n't believe it is for sale in the USA but you can watch it online . If you thought he looked different in How To Be , what until you see him in this .
