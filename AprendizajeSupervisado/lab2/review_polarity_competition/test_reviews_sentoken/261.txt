The acting was ok , so I 'll start with that . The movie seemed like a good idea that never made it passed just that : a good idea . But hey , even though I think it was terrible , some `` churchy '' people like the main character will watch it , and the message will minister to them . I doubt this movie was meant for anyone outside the church anyway.The ENTIRE movie was dialogue . Long , boring , completely uninspired dialogue . There are some quick short books on screenwriting that could have helped here tremendously . There are a ton of concepts that need to be communicated for anyone outside church culture to understand the story , but there was no creative attempt in conveying anything . With all the talking you had to listen to it did n't help that the sound was n't that great , either too loud , soft , or heavy echoing at times.Attempts in creative photography were utter flops , and the boom mic made a cameo appearance within the first 10 minutes . The `` fancy '' restaurant staging took away more production value than it was worth aiming for . This film simply did n't have to look as low budget as it did . Black & white flashback scenes were cliche , and some shots just left me hoping they 'll do MUCH better next time.I rented this movie from the Redbox thinking if a faith-based movie made it into the Redbox it must be pretty good . I know better now . Not only am I a devoted Christ-follower and filmmaker , I also live in the area this film was shot in , so when I say it was hard to stomach it 's for good reason . Hopefully I can get in touch with them and we can collab on something better .
