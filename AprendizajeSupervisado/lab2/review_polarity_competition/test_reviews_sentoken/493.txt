I rated one star not for the show itself , but for this DVD and the few others that were released . These DVDs are missing a few minutes , often the teasers before the theme song comes on . I am also befuddled at the lack of a complete season or series set.It would be so awesome if a series boxed set was released , with each and every minute of the show accounted for , and the Ask Jackie bits as well . I 'm not sure why the quality of these DVDs are so poor , or why only a couple were ever released .
