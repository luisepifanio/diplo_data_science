I have an old 80s VHS of this from a budget label that cost me $ 4 back in the day . And it still looks better . Heads get cut off , scratches galore . And it sounded better -- Madacy should 've added subtitles to `` The Pharmacist . '' Many of the shorts ca n't even track the audio ; people talk a beat before their mouths move.I did n't get my money 's worth , and I paid $ 6 !
