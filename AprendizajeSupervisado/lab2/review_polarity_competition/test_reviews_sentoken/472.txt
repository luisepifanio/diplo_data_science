The title is somewhat misleading , because this lengthy documentary is about so much more than the Canterbury Tales . Indeed , it covers Chaucer 's life and career and the various literary works he produced , including the Canterbury Tales , but also Book of the Duchess , etc . It also provides a great deal of incidental information about life in the 14th-century , the politics , economic situation , the Black Plague , the 1381 Rising , etc . Terry Jones is not only a member of the Python group , but also a published scholar about the 14th century , including books about Chaucer 's pilgrim knight ( titled Chaucer 's Knight ) , and the politics near the end of Chaucer 's life ( Who Murdered Chaucer ? ) . He has participated in other documentaries about the period that are a bit more humorous and Python-esque , such as the delightful series , Medieval Lives . However , this foray is much more serious . The length would make it cumbersome to show in a single class period , but at the college level , it would be a useful adjunct , for viewing in the library , for students taking courses in Chaucer and other medieval literature . I did not have any problems with the sound or understanding the accents .
