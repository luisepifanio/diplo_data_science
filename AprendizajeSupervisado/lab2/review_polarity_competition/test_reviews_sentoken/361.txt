I am absolutely done watching Ben Affleck movies . He has to be the worst actor earning a Hollywood mega-million paycheck over the past decade . I made it through `` Jersey Girl '' only because of Liv Tyler . However , `` Surviving Christmas '' ( 2004 ) was just torture . James Gandalfini was okay , but does he ever play any role out of his `` Tony Soprano '' character ? Christina Applegate ( who is her agent and when will she be in a great movie ? ) was good , but it just looked like she was n't into this movie . I like Catherine O'Hara a ton ( `` Best In Show '' , A '' Mighty Wind '' , `` Home Alone '' , `` Beetlejuice '' and the old SCTV ) , and she was simply over the top in some scenes ( in a garrish way ) and dare I say I did n't like her acting in this movie . Affleck 's acting is pitifully canned and he just is n't convincing . ** FACT : This movie has the shortest period of time ( less than nine weeks ) between its theatrical debut and release on DVD/Video than any other major release film in Hollywood history . *** FACT : The production was shot without a complete script . Per Gandolfini , `` much of the film was improvised '' . What 's that tell you ? This movie should 've ended in the first 20 minutes when Gandolfini 's character hit Affleck 's character over the head with a snow shovel . 91 minutes of pure drudgery .
