This video seems much more geared toward older children and adults than the typical Sesame Street age child . The dialouge linking the video segments together does not hold the interest of my 19 month old . The music segments are more interesting to me than they are to her . It does very little to engage my young viewer . I would suggest Barney , Blues Clues , or Bear in the Big Blue House over this video , especially for the under three crowd .
