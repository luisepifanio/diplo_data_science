Watched because a friend of mine has a bit part - love Kasdan 's stuff most of the time - liked the cast - but horribly edited ( I assume there was a better script to start with ! ) - zero dimensional characters - hard to say if I was more disappointed in this than HOPE SPRINGS , which was also awful - such a shame because this demographic deserves good movies and the failure of both of these will prevent more movies made for us boomers !
