If you 're curious about Hungarian cinema , and `` Mephisto '' is the only Szabo film you 've seen , take a chance on this excellent , much earlier black and white effort . `` Father '' reminds me of some of Truffaut 's films about childhood and coming of age , but the unique experience of Hungary and Hungarians in the 20th century lends Szabo 's film a special poignacy worlds apart from Truffaut . Not that you need to know all the ins and outs of 20th Century Hungarian history to appreciate the film , but the more you do know , the more you probably will appreciate some of the layers of irony and humor in this memorable little film .
