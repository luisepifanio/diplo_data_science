For $ 10 , this is NOT the full length movie delievered over instant video . It is the first 22 minutes , with no way or option to purchase the entire movie . Save your money , buy the DVD . This particular Instant purchase is a complete rip-off.The only thing right is that Amazon 's refund departments did refund my purchase almost immediately . This item needs to be removed until they get it right . Because this is just blatantly misleading .
