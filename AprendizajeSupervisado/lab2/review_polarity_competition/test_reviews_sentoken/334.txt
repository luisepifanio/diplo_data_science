The Affair of the Necklace is an entertaining and lavish retelling of the infamous scandal , in the years just prior to the outbreak of the French Revolution , that invloved a disgraced countess , a lecherous cardinal , the Queen of France , and a fabulous diamond necklace . Hillary Swank plays the Comtesse de la Motte Valois , the daughter of a disgraced and murdered nobleman who is obsessed with reclaiming her title and her lands . Though married to a rakish philanderer , she falls in with a handsome though disreputable courtier named Rateux de Villet and the two hatch a ploy to use the rich and influential cardinal Rohan to buy the necklace , supposedly for Marie Antoinette , but in reality so that the Comtesse can use the diamonds to buy back her estate and reinstate her family 's reputation . Once the cardinal realizes he has been duped he sets out to bring down the conspirators , but before he can , he himself is accused of complicity in the affair , along with his shady and mysterious & quot ; mystic & quot ; advisor Count Cagliostro , played by an outrageously wonderful Christopher Walken . The ensuing scandal enflames the country as the public , already resentful of the extravagance and indifference of the aristocracy , blame the ostentaciously elegant Antoinette as the true architect of the affair . The resulting backlash over the scandal helps to ingnite the Revolution and sends Antoinette and Louis XVI to the guillotine . The Affair of the Necklace has its faults , but overall it is engaging and beautifully filmed , with sumptuous costumes and lavish sets . Swank is a little out of her element as the noble Comtesse , but even her American accent and sometimes cheesy dialogue can be overlooked . Walken is over-the-top but enjoyable as the charlatan seer Cagliostro , Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the sleazy cardinal Rohan , and Joley Richardson gives a good performance in her role as Marie Antoinette . This is an enjoyable piece of historic drama .
