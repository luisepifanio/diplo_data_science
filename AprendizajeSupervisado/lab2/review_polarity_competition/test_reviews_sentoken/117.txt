In my view this is one of the greatest films ever made . I tink it is the best of the trilogy and can not be missed . Everyone has seen it at least once in their lives and everyone I know that has seen it thought it was amazing . The film itself is just an unbelievable mixture of everything you can think of . Chris Lloyd plays the & quot ; mad scientist & quot ; and does it with enthusiasm and great character . While Mike J Fox plays the main character & quot ; Marty & quot ; who is forced to go back in time to escape the people who killed his friend & quot ; The Doc & quot ; . It might not appeal to some but it has a great story and will keep you watching for the whole movie . Robert Zemeckis did an amazing job of bringing this film to where it is now with some of the best special effects in the 80 's . I 'm sure it will be a stunning DVD conversion and a must buy for any Back To The Future fans .
