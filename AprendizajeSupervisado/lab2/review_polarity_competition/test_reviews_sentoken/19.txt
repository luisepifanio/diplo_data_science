I 'm a guy who started college the year this story began . Boy did it bring back memories . I watched it with a woman in the same age bracket and each of us cringed with the truths we remembered . Instructors subject to curfews , predatory professors , unchanging lesson plans , drinking at proms , pushy parents , that stolen `` adult '' week-end , and social pecking orders.There were only a few false spots . I suspect they grew out of telling a 50 year-old story by 35 year-old writers.For parents of teen-aged girls . Tell them they ca n't watch it to make sure they want to . They need to see where we came from .
