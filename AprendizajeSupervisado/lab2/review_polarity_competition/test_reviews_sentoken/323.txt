Back when I first heard about this movie hitting Thailand After France ( and it being dubbed in English ) I had to pick it up . After watching the Thailand DVD with no extras I was hooked . This was one of the best horror films in years.One of the main reasons this movie was so good is its style . The film is made to look like a horror movie that was made in the late 70 's into early 80 's . The film feels gritty . The picture quality is grate and the sound only adds ( Some sounds are taken out of edited versions . ex : the circular saw scraping bone ) . It 's gritty in the way that it plays out . YOU really feel the tension . Trust Me.The effects go back to the basics of latex and silicone ( Thank god ) . In this world of new horror movies using extremely fake 3d graphics it 's nice to see some people still believe in the purist approach . I know some movies use the 3D well do n't get me wrong.If you do n't plan on buying this movie then please rent it . I personally own 3 copies . One from Thailand , the UK , and France .
