What 's amazing about Disney 's 4th feature , & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; , is that it is probably one of the most simple looking animated features of all time , yet it is one of the best . Proving that even the most detailed art is not required to carry a movie , most of the films backgrounds and characters are not as intricate and detailed as & quot ; Snow White & quot ; or & quot ; Pinocchio & quot ; , they are VERY simple . & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; instead relys on a good story , that I 'm sure you are fimiliar with . A simple , but rich 64 minutes telling the story of a baby elephant with big ears , that is an outcast . The reason that this movie has lasted for so long , aside from being Disney , is that everyone can relate to it , as said throughout the disc 's extras and commentary.The DVD has a good Dolby Digital 5.1 mix , but I was rather disappointed with the picture quality . It claims to have a remastered picture , but there is so much grain , and dirt throughout the feature . After what Disney DVD did for & quot ; Snow White & quot ; , I was expecting a little more for this release . The extras are great : the commentary is very informative , the concept arts are interesting , and & quot ; Celebrating Dumbo & quot ; is a good enough featurette . The only negative is that Disney Co. is continuing to ruin the classics , by attaching unnecessary sequels . Inferior by existing Disney video sequel reputation , & quot ; Dumbo II & quot ; is on it 's way. & quot ; Dumbo & quot ; , costing only $ 800,000 , saved Disney from the WWII-caused financial failures of & quot ; Pinocchio & quot ; and & quot ; Fantasia & quot ; . So it is one of the important stepping blocks of Disney 's history and one of the most enjoyable animated features of all time .
