Still Crazy is a melancholy look at aging rock and roll stars as they try to recreate their youthful musical experience . In this , it is really a metaphor for all of us , as we reminisce about what we were and what we are , and `` what might have been . '' Bill Nighy is once again excellent in his lead singer role . The music is surprisingly poignant and accessible . There are a lot of laughs here , but the underlying theme is quite serious . This is a DVD for your collection .
