Well , the movie is good and what little bonus features are actually present are great , but I was a little disappointed to find out that it did n't have any deleted or extend scenes . For people that want the movie for the movie this is a good option , but for those of us that want more than just the actual movie I would suggest getting the movie from somewhere else . Just saying .
