I first saw this as a special on the Discovery Network 's Military Channel . I had to wait several months before it became available on Amazon but it was worth the wait to own it . These men 's stories are compelling and fascinating . This dvd should be shown in every civics class in the country ( provided we started HAVING civics classes again ) .The men who trained at Camp Ritchie were almost exclusively European Jewish refugees who had just recently escaped from the Nazis . Yet they all volunteered to return to Europe to serve their newly adopted country.They all took this very seriously but the dvd does make use of the usual humorous soldier stories . Such as the one where two of the Richie Boys who are now with the US Army in a forward area doing POW interrogations complete a fake prisoner interrogation report stating that they have captured Hitler 's latrine orderly and he gave them very detailed information on the fuhrer 's private parts . They sent it to their immediate superiors and they all had a good laugh . Until someone forwarded it to a higher HQ and a Colonel from Washington showed up to meet the latrine orderly for himself ! This is a must for any student of WW II .
