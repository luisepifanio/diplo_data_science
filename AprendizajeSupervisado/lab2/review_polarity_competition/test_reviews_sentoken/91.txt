A combination of eating healthy foods and doing this video helped me lose twenty-five pounds in a month and a half . This is exactly what I needed to keep me moving . This video is not for experienced marathon runners or people that want super high-impact workouts . the movements were not hard to get and they are not `` dancy '' like other aerobic video workouts.I would wake up every morning and do this workout for 30 minutes every day . Doing these workouts helped me to sleep better , gave me more energy , and helped me to feel better about myself ! ! Thirty minutes a day is not a lot at all and I found myself doing these workouts whenever I was bored or had extra time on my hands . This video looks a little outdated and the music might be a little cheesy for some of the younger crowd , but it works and that is what really matters . I urge anyone that is concerned about their health or wants to lose weight to give this video a try.You DO N'T need to get the one mile walk first . The DVD allows for one to finish the first mile and skip to the cool down very easily . Try this ! ! THIS is a miracle weight loss program . It helped me realize that exercise and proper diet is the ONLY way to lose weight and stay healthy . I 've moved on to other videos by Leslie , but I still use this video . It 's great !
