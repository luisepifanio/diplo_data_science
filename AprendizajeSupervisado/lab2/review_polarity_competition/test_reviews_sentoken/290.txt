the 100 minute original US release deserves 5 stars , this one gets 0 ( but amazon made me give at least one star ) . here 's why : **SPOILER ALERT**the rearranging of the first few scenes in the film kinda bothered me , but not that much . i guess i just was n't used to it playing out that way . i gave it the benefit of the doubt at first , then ... .the first thing that REALLY stood out as being a bad edit was the chunk of scene that was removed after the ship started sinking . he cut out when they hit the sea floor and noticed it was peculiarly shallow . in doing this , one of my favorite bits was removed `` how deep IS the ocean ? '' `` very deep ... .usually '' . that scene was essential . if you were in a panic about your ship sinking into the ocean , and all of a sudden it was n't , you would comment on it , right ? ! it only got worse from there ... this was the worst part : he cut dialogue and left the scenes in ! the second half of the edge of the world scene looked like helen keller edited it . the dialogue track was removed and you SEE the yelling back and forth of lines between tim and imogen , but only hear background noise . then the middle of one of her lines was crappily tacked on at the end . it was painfully obvious that it was n't what she was actually saying . no effort was made to match it up . unacceptable . they really should have just re-released the original . i did appreciate the sharper picture and widescreen format on the dvd , but other than that , it should have been left as it was . in trying to make the story more concise , he hacked it to nonsensical peices .
