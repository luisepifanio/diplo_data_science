It seems that one never tires of this film . It is just so entertaining . The script , the dialog , the acting , the sets , the colors , the editing , Dimitri Tiomkin 's score and Alfred Hitchcock 's suspenseful direction in the confined set all congeal into a now classic film ( even though Hitchcock somewhat played down the importance of this film in his list of directorial achievements ) . This VHS copy looks much better than earlier releases of this title .
