Eric Burden is a favorite of mine but this disc is close to being unacceptable . The sound quality is so poor , it leaves you wondering how it was recorded . In the content you see camera operators with what seems like high-quality cameras but both the video and the audio are marginal at best . The audio sounds like it was recorded with a camcorder mike ! I suggest this disc only for Eric diehards !
