Check out the various versions on the Amazon search facility and you 'll mostly see Marilyn featured as the main image on most of the DVD boxes , the reality is that she appears for less than five minutes and her dialogue could be read in about two.I found my copy in a supermarket at such a low price that I wondered if anyone was making anything on it , they were of course . The reason I bought it was the title and the fact that it was made in the early fifties and I was right , it does show everyday life in small-city USA . You 'll get to see middle class domestic housing , interior decor , fashions , buses , trains , planes ( even a newspaper delivery boy on one of those Cushman motor scooters ) and a simple homey story with a bit of economic theory chucked in as well ... and that 's it.Without a photo of Ms Monroe on the front nobody would be interested ( apart from me of course ) . It will probably continue to be re-released every few years to attract another wave of new MM fans but it really should have been forgotten decades ago .
