I first saw Brendan Fraser 's `` Journey to the Center of the Earth '' , soon after its 2008 release , on a flight to Budapest . I knew in only a few minutes into this adventure that it is destined for greatness . I was simply delighted to learn that a 3-D version was to be released as DVD.The 3-D version makes this great flick better ! Everything across the screen literally jumps out at you . You will want to retrieve you favorite 3-D specs and watch it in a dark room.Fraser , Hutcherson , and Briem give stellar performances with the Weiss , Flackett , and Levin screenplay that follows Jules Vern 's original novel . As the characters progress deep down into the earth we learn applied science while being entertained by science fiction . We see diamonds galore in volcano tubes , luminescent birds , hungry sea monsters , floating rocks , and even a crazed T-Rex . 3-D adds to this excitement . ( One hopes that these moviemakers will indeed make a sequel- hinted about Atlantis- in the final scene ) .With no foul , or even curt , language and a short flirtive , but not suggestive , romance this action packed flick is the best movie of 2008 . It is a great date movie and recommended to adventure movie lovers of all ages .
