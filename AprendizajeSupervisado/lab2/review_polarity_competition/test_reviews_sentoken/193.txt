How can I possibly express my disappointment at this unwarranted mangling of a perfectly charming little movie ? A big fan of the original cut of _Erik the Viking_ , and having nearly worn out my old VHS copy , I was eagerly anticipating the DVD release . I was a little surprised when the negative reviews here indicated that the movie had been severely edited ( - 25 minutes ! ) for the DVD release , and decided to rent it before buying . This was fortunate , because I not only saved myself a few dollars , but the disappointment of having rewarded those responsible for this inexplicable re-cut.I could have , perhaps , coped with the fact that some of my favorite little moments have been edited out ( e.g . `` Slow down , you fool , no one can row that fast ! `` ) , but the edits are executed so abruptly , so haphazardly , that I have to wonder if the director 's son either suffers from ADHD or was paid for every second he could excise from the movie . Take , for instance , the scene in which Erik and his followers are walking through the outer hall of Valhalla in search of the gods , the heroic music is swelling in the background , and WHAM ! we get an immediate cut to the next shot . `` Jarring '' would be an understatement.Directors ( and presumably sons ) certainly reserve the right to go back and finesse their own works , however the director 's son has committed the same error in judgement as George Lucas did in finessing the hell out of a charming , if imperfect , film that the fans nevertheless adore . Due to the enormous outcry from Lucas ' legions of fans , he finally conceded to releasing the unedited original theatrical cuts of the _Star Wars_ movies on DVD . However , I fear that , since _Erik the Viking_ does not enjoy the phenomenal level of support of the Star Wars franchise , we will never see an original DVD release of our beloved little movie . What a shame .
