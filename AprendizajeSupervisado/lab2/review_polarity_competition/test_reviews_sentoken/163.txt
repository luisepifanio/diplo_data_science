Loosely based on the book ( which my son also loved ) . The main character is about 12 and moves at the begining of the movie . He encounters a bully on the first day of school who hides worms in his lunch box . This later escalates into a bet that he can eat 10 worms in one day . A hilarious Saturday is spent with a group of 8-10 boys collecting & cooking worms while being kicked out of various parks , homes , etc . The movie ends with everyone being friends.Most of the humor is of the sort that appeals to boys of this age but I laughed too . Secondary story lines involve the little brother ( around 4 ) , a neighborhood girl ( who is teased about her height ) , and dad 's new job . The group of boys includes all types ( athletes , computer geeks , shy , outgoing , etc . ) so it is nice to see them working together.The DVD has a good behind the scenes documentary that interviews the child actors , the guy who made the fake worms , the special effects people that `` microwaved '' a worm , etc . My son really enjoyed it as well .
