Disgusting ! ! A freaking waste of time ... I read the book before watching the movie.. and the book was amazing ! ! I ca n't believe they butchered the whole thing by making this movie ! ! ! ******It was NOTHING like the book , and EVEN IF THERE NEVER WAS A BOOK.. THIS MOVIE WOULD STILL BE VERY BAD ! ! ! ****** I ca n't believe I wasted approximately 1 hour and 38 minutes I will NEVER get back EVER ! ! ! I do n't know whether to laugh at the horrible plot , uninspired characters or cry because I made myself endure this piece of trash . I was so disgusted that I wanted all of them to die just to make myself feel better .
