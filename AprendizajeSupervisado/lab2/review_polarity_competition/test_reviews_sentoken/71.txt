Wonderful yet sad to watch . Most special moment for me was when he called out the names of his brothers one by one and then his mom and dad during the rehearsal of I 'LL BE THERE . It was like a premonition . He spoke special words and then faded out to black . WOW ! ! ! Kenny Ortega and his gang did a phenominal job ! Kudos to Kenny for his commitment and dedication to creating this moving tribute to Michael ! ! ! ! ( Ny only concern was for Paris , Prince and Blanket for what their emotions probably were watching the Thriller part . -- I hope someone talked to them about that after they saw it ) . God bless Michael and rest in peace.Thank you Michael .
