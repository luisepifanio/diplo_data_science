Here it is ... finally ! Bass Extremes on DVD ! ! Better picture , stunning sound ... the digital version blows the VHS version out of the water ! Steve Bailey and Victor Wooten will melt your mind with this amazing show of bass guitar mastery . Together with acclaimed drummer Gregg Bissonette , Steve and Victor take it to the 'extreme ' , using their basses to play rhythm , lead , piano and guitar-like parts ... filling all slots of the band , in a variety of musical genre 's . After each song they take you through a breakdown of what they were playing , adding tips , tricks , and some hilarious commentary . The DVD has a few added features that the VHS does n't have ... but for me it was mainly about the quality of the digital version , as well as longevity ... my VHS copy is wearing thin ! ! Also has the option to watch the perforamce in its entirety , without the commentary between songs . If you only have the audio cd , or even already have the VHS ... .the DVD is A MUST HAVE , IMO ... SUPERB ! ! ! Since this was shot in 1993 , also check out their follow up CD 's to the original , Bass Extremes : Cookbook , and Bass Extremes : Just Add Water . You can see what Steve and Victor are up to at www.stevebaileybass.com and www.victorwooten.comIt does n't get any better than this ! ! !
