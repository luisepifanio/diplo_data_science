This DVD is captured in the late 80 's , and features an Eric Burdon Band including Jamie Moses on guitar . The performance is excelent , but there are several reasons to AVOID this DVD:1 . It 's a bootleg , and you will cause Eric econimical harm by buying it.2 . The sound is AWFUL ! You ca n't hear Erics singing , and when you ca n't do that , you miss the whole point of the gig.3 . It 's very short ! Only a 3/4 hour or so.Hopefully , this will talk you out of buying it : - ) And if you want a really good concert DVD with Eric , buy the Live at The Coach House DVD !
