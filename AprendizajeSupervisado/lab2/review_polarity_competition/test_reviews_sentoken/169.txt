Heroic Legend of Arslan is an absolutely stunning anime visually with an enchanting story , when I first saw it I was a little leery , I generally prefer newer animes to older ones like this but it was well worth getting . It is visually beautiful and unlike some animes where you get this gorgeous cover art but the anime its self is not nearly as detailed , what you see it was you get . The story is also amazing , a fantasy that takes place in ancient Persia , war , political intrigue and all that fun stuff . With all that said the anime definitely has its quirks and it ends on a cliffhanger . So if you 're not into quirks and cliffhangers that will probably never be finished this definitely is n't for you , but if you can over look those things and simply enjoy a good fantasy anime then you should see about checking this one out .
