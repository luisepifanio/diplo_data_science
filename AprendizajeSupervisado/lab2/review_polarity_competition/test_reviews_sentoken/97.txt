From its startling opening which fuses comedy , pity , and shocking violence , `` Punch-Drunk Love '' keeps you uncomfortably off-balance for all 95 minutes . How refreshing . How refreshing , too , that although this is a story about the redemptive power of love it never degenerates into mawkishness ; and although the situations it puts them in are faintly ludicrous , the characters are painfully real . This is such a pleasant change for romantic comedy and , amazingly , it 's Adam Sandler who holds it all together . It 's an inspired piece of casting because Sandler brings with him all the baggage of his previous on-screen inanity - he has your expectations heading in one direction while writer/director Anderson 's clever little screenplay quietly takes you in another . It 's a weird ride , but one that 's utterly mesmerizing .
