I first saw this when I was a kid when HBO was playing constantly . I loved it then , and I 'm surprised at how much I still enjoy it . Simply told , a poorly treated mother gets to escape for a summer with her boyfriend . She deems her daughter too immature and selfish to run the house , so she hires a baby sitter . Good call , except the old lady dies the first night . The story stays good , and the acting is decent for the kid and adult actors . Give it a try !
