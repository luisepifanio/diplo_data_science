For me , & quot ; Apocalypse Now & quot ; was always more about the journey and not so much about the destination . With the release of & quot ; Apocalypse Now Redux & quot ; on DVD , my opinion has n't changed . The added scenes of & quot ; Redux & quot ; give more depth to Captain Williard 's journey , but the destination , i.e. , the termination of Colonel Kurtz & quot ; with extreme prejudice & quot ; still is somewhat of a let down . Dennis Hopper 's babbling photojournalist character seems even more ridiculous and annoying today than he did 20 plus years ago . And , in my humble opinion , Brando 's performance is way overrated . Still , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and , for that reason , & quot ; Apocalypse Now Redux & quot ; gets my four stars.The DVD presentation is an entirely different story , however ; Paramount really blew it with this release . Yes , they have given us the additional 49 minutes of restored footage that is & quot ; Redux , & quot ; but there are absolutely no extras save the & quot ; Redux & quot ; trailer . No director's/actor 's commentary . No & quot ; behind the scenes & quot ; footage . No biographies of Francis Ford Coppola or any of the principal actors . No production notes . Nada . Nothing . Come on , Paramount , that 's what DVD is all about , especially for a film like & quot ; Apocalypse Now Redux. & quot ; One star ( and a raspberry ) for the cheapskates at Paramount .
