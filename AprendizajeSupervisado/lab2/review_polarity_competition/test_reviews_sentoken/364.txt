When I purchased this dvd , I thought this would be a good show for me and my grown daughter to watch . We only watch 5mins of this show and in the trash it went . It 's just not my preference . The product details on Amazon , does say this dvd is unrated . But , here is what it does n't say , `` contains brief nudity , strong language and adult situations and recommended for age 17+ '' , which is on the back on the dvd .
