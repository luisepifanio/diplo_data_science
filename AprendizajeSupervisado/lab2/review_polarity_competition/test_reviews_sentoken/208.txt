I first saw Conan in the seventh grade . I loved it back then and will cherish it forever . This was before Arnold was Arnie , when he was campily cool and had no superstar appeal . Back in the days when you could punch a camel , and that damn camel would stay down ! By Crom , this flick is a good time . Today , it 's lack of political correctness makes it practically avant-garde . This is a man 's movie and its perpetual action and incredily sexy female characters are truly the stuff of intense fantasy.However , as much as I love the big man , James Earl Jones practically steals the spotlight away from him . His is a perfect Thulsa Doom and yards ahead of the rest of the cast , but what else should we expect ? Jones has been great forever.Additionally , it 's worth seeing just for the theme alone . In my humble opinion , that 's the finest theme song I 've ever heard . I own the soundtrack , but , of course , that 's another review . There may not be time for that discussion as `` do [ we ] really want to live forever ? ''
