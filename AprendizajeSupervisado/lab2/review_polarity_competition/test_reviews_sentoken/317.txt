I purchased this DVD set on impulse the other evening . It was on the clearance shelf and I thought `` why not '' . Was I surprised when I started watching it and noticed that none of the episodes had the original theme song opening , just guitar strumming . It gets irritating after awhile . Its also unclear if the episodes are even supposed to be chronologically . In short , skip it . I see there are more authorized offerings of this show out there . There should be some sort of disclaimer on the box .
