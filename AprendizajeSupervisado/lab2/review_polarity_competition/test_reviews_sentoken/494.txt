Carnivale was a wonderful , but sometimes very hard look into a forgotten era of Americana . When I was a child , I can remember going to the Carnivale in the Summertime . This show was a Bonus , `` Spiritual , Mytical , and light/Dark themes . I loved this show . I am very happy to own the series , to visit anytime I want to .
