The music track of this version is made up of various romantic symphonies and overtures . At first the effect seems quite pleasing . Then you realize that no attempt has been made to match the mood of the visuals with the music , so you end up with things like a light-hearted scherzo during the first appearance of the vampire , or Dvorak 's `` New World '' symphony over the arrival of the vampire in Bremen . The music track eventually becomes an unbearable distraction and the only thing to do is to hit the mute button .
