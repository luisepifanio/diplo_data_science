After watching I can do bad all by myself , I never thought things could get worse but I stand corrected . Next came the sequel to 'Why did I get married ' . Admittedly , I loved the first movie so I was looking forward to seeing the second and boy was I disappointed . Key things:1 . Character development - All the relationships all seemed to go wrong , especially the Gavin and Stacey marriage which seemed to be standing on solid rock from the last movie . Watched this movie and came out not really understanding why ? Why would such a solid relationship that seemed to be healing from the first movie suddenley end up being so catastrophic in the end ? 2 . Angela - This character just ended up being the stereotypical loud , black woman . To be honest , this character took a life of its own and became unrealistic and mellodramatic ... ..it 's a shame that the screen writer and director of this film did not realize when to press the stop button on the crazy . Plus no brother like Marcus would ever stay with any woman with that much crazy in her.This movie is nothing short of intellectually insulting.Tyler should stay away from writing movies as what is clear is that his talent is better placed in the Chitlin circuit ... or at least he should go to film school , it would definitely help .
