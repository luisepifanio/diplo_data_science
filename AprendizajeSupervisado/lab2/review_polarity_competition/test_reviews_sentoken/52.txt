I am an old Amazon customer and this is my first review ever . I was so disappointed that I felt important to share my opinion on this DVD.The image quality on this DVD is mediocre at best : faded , yellowed and contrastless . Everything looks like 20 year old footage put together on the cheap . The `` Digitally Mastered '' DVD shows scratches and spots you would see on an old movie or a projected 8mm film.If you think you can not live without it , get the VHS version , that 'll save you a buck .
