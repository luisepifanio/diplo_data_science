I like how they did n't try to overwrite this . The movie flowed organically ... the situations were real-life and the performances were dead-on of how people really talk in movies . Another glimpse into the incredible range of Martin Lawrence . I think we should all be as impressed as possible . The writers did the audience a favor by not defying our expectations and keeping this digestible to all by keeping it as even-keeled and reaction-proof as possible . Not every movie can do that !
