This movie is absolutely ridiculous and the only reason I gave it two stars was for the pretty scenery while they 're in the Bahamas . I seriously could not believe this movie and truly wanted to stop watching , but like witnessing a train wreck , I could not pull myself away . Honestly , after the first movie that seemed to end with some redeeming qualities about marriage , I thought this one would continue in the same vein , but this was just a marriage basher . After watching this , why would anyone think marriage is a good thing ? Two couples have major trust issues , another one has a wife on the verge of an affair , and the last one , the Janet Jackson marriage is beyond awful . Her character , which always seemed the somewhat calm one , turns into this raging lunatic who wants a divorce for reasons we never know . All in all , please skip this tragically horrible movie . It 's not worth the time !
