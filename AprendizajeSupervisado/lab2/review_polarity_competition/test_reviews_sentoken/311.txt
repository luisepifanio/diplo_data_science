Let 's start with the comment that this movie is visually stunning . One could turn off the audio and be dazzled by the sheer brillance of the videography . However , if one did that , they would miss one of the best tales of true survival EVER placed on the big screen . The book details the events more clearly , but there is no lack of drama , suspense , passion or emotion in the feature film . In the same league with `` Into Thin Air '' ( the book ) , this film is an ABSOLUTE MUST for ANY mountaineer , climber , or adventure traveler .
