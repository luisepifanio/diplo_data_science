Everyone knows this film , right ? It 's essential watching for children of all ages . Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny , and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.Anyways , I recently purchased the Gold Collection DVD of this classic movie . It is essentially the same as the previous Disney release except for a few points . First , this one actually *has* a few extras , which most of the early Disney DVDs lacked ( shame on Disney ! ) . The transfer is the same , but in addition , we now have a documentary on the film , a trailer , a short premiere featurette , and a trivia game . It 's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing spectacular , but it 's an improvement for Disney . Oh yes , and there are those annoying trailers at the beginning of the DVD that Disney likes to put on all its DVDs . Oh well.If you have the DVD already , do n't bother buying this one . If you do n't have the DVD , by all means purchase the Gold collection Mary Poppins . It 's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the family over and over again .
