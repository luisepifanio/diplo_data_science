Just a warning for JVC DVD player owners , this DVD will not play on certain models . I have model XV-501BK and tried 3 different copies before I called JVC and found out that they are aware that the formatting of Dinosaur ca n't be read by my player model . I own over 100 DVDs and they all play except this one . My player can read the supplemental features disc but not the movie disc . Very frustrating ! Since I ca n't watch it I gave it a 1 rating but this rating may not accurately reflect the quality and other features that are on disc 1 .
