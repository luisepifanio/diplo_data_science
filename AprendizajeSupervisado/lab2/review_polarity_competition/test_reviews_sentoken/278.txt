This film , made for television , and for an audience of children , was initially titled THE MEDICINE HAT STALLION , for its video release as ROUGH RIDER , and revolves about the newly organized Pony Express , immediately before the outbreak of hostilities that launched the War Between The States , with its plot focussing upon a 15 year old boy , Peter Lundy ( Leif Garrett ) , who lives at his father 's trading post in Nebraska Territory , including his adventures after he leaves his home to pledge loyalty to the fledgling mail delivery service . Young Peter yearns to break loose from beneath the control of his stern father Jethro ( Mitchell Ryan ) , who operates the trading post on the North Platte River , and when an opportunity comes to be an Express rider , he takes it despite the disapproval of his sire . Peter has trained his own mount , an erstwhile Pawnee stallion he has named Domingo , and after he begins employment as a rider , the youth is propelled into manhood through a series of exploits . Based upon Marguerite Henry 's novel for young readers , the work is filmed in New Mexico and benefits from some first-rate production values , in particular those pertinent to matters of historical research , and is photographed very effectively in Panavision ; however , a torpid tone is maintained throughout and deployment of a small , illy conditioned crew of `` Indian '' extras is not useful . Although there are fine turns contributed by John Quade as the post blacksmith , Milo O'Shea as an eccentric surveyor and , notably , Ryan with a fascinating reading as the tormented senior Lundy , the affair flags whenever the androgynous Garrett is onscreen , because he simply does not convince as a stalwart pioneer lad .
