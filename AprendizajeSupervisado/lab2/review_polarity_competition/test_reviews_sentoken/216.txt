Roger Corman 's films have been the unfortunate victim of many terrible releases ; this is one of them . While the print quality varies , it 's mostly subpar to unwatchable . How these companies stay in business is a mystery when the product is so bad . There are much better transfers on some of these titles ( The Terror , one of the most widely available in terrible prints , was just released in a pristine DVD and Blu-ray combo ) . Do n't be fooled by the low price ; this is n't worth a nickel .
