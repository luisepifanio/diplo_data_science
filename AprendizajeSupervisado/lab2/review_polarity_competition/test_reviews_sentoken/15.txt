I dont mean to be so negative but I 'm a business person and I dont have the time or energy to send this back and im annoyed . I was looking for some good educational information and this was a joke . This is an outdated video of three guys catching fish and complementing each other . No tackle discussions , no bait discussion . I am frankly floored this is even being sold . A guide to saltwater fishing should take you through tackle , bait , techiniques , locations , tips . I have 5 other videos of the series and I hope they are produced with education in mind .
