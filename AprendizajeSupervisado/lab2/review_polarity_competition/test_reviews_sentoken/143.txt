This forgotten teen cult classic is just great ! The horrible acting and plot makes it one heck of a gut-buster ! You 'll definitely want to add this to your B-Movie list.But surprisingly , this movie does n't only stand out for its sheer B-Movie brilliance , but also for its brave and unique tones . Unlike every other teen movie from the 80's- this drama/comedy deals with situations that are far more realistic , and in some ways more shocking than your average & quot ; Let 's Get Laid & quot ; movie . The ending is what earns the movie its 5th Star . Somehow , this raunchy screwball teen-flick manages to make the Gary character believable . You suddenly begin to feel for him , and when the story finally builds up to such an unexpected , negative and heartbreaking ending ... it reminds you of just how unfair love can be.A very good movie !
