VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET was made in 1965 , stars Basil Rathbone , and the cover depicts one snarling and one glaring dinosaur towering over three space-suited astronauts . Does anything more really need be said ? Plot - The year is 2020 and American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts are traveling to Venus . I 've read somewhere that this is a Russia film that had scenes inserted and some phony American credits plastered on it prior to release , but was n't interested enough to see if my favorite internet search engine could cough up the answers to that mystery . Rathbone plays a scientist on the satellite Lunar 7 and the other ` star ' in this one , Faith Domergue , is an astronautlette on the Venus-orbiting Vega . A handful of ` nauts and John the Robot are on the Venus surface , dodging the stray alamosaurus and/or 12-foot-tall man-eating venus flytrap while finding evidence of an ancient Venusian civilization . There probably was an okay Russian movie here before Roger Corman Productions got their hands on this one . John the Robot is cool and some of the special effects are a cut above the standard glop they were putting out then . The story drags terribly , though , and Rathbone is apparently included for name recognition rather than to serve the plot or to move things along . Thankfully , they do n't dress him up in a goofy costume or otherwise embarrass him . The pacing is terrible , the dubbing is atrocious and there 's no drama to speak of . The print , although the color is somewhat washed out and there are some scratches , is in okay condition . Not recommended .
