i have tryed to figure out why evry one hates this movioe so much . does it have aliens ? yes . does it have predators ? yes . does it have aliens vering predators ? yes ... ... ... ... .then whats your problem ? and all this rubbish about card board acting ? have you seen the sequal ? now THATS card board acting . this movie isnt exactly fast paced , but look at the alien and predator movies . in alien , you didnt see the actual alien till 40 minutes in ! and in predator you didnt see it until the last hour or so . so , really its just following the formila of the movies its contecting . the plot makes sense , and involves both aliens and predators fighting to the daeth ( where as other versus films eg freddy vs jason , it felt like an elm street movie with jason in it a bit ) . so , if you are a fan of both the alien or predator movies , i suggest you check this one out , you either like it or you dont .
