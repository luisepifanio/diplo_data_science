I rented this movie from the Redbox down the street for my kids this weekend , and though my five year old liked it enough to want to watch it again ( actually , he barely watched it , just sort of played around with the TV as a base to come back to now and then ) , I have to say that it is the worst movie I 've ever seen -- and that 's a moniker I do n't wield lightly . Animation : graceless , indescript and horrible . Writing : a deplorably plotless mishmash . Characters : voids composed of blank , dunderheaded pixels . Dialogue : stupid , cliched , and at times impossible to follow . I echo too that some of the action scenes -- all of which are sensless and jumbled -- are grotesque and bordering on downright inappropriate . You know when you see a low budget movie and its so tastelee that you are n't sure whether you want to trust it to not make you feel disturbed or disgusted ? Well , this movie gives me that feeling . I hate it when I get through a movie and feel that I just squandered and hour or two of my time here on Earth . It makes me feel guilty and depressed . That 's this disaster in a nutshell .
