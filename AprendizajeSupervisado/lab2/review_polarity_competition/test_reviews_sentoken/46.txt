For such a great movie , I wonder why there are hardly any reviews ... & quot ; Inventing the Abbots & quot ; is a sweet , old fashioned love story , but just because it 's set in the 5O 's & amp ; 6O 's , does n't mean it does n't get a little wild ! Its rated & quot ; R & quot ; for a reason ~ it includes sex scenes , brief nudity , foul language , etc ... .JOAQUIN PHOENIX and BILLY CRUDUP star as 2 working class teenage brothers who happen to be infatuated by the prettiest and wealthiest girls in town ; the 3 Abbott sisters played by JOANNA GOING , JENNIFER CONNELLY , & amp ; LIV TYLER . Over the years they get involved w/ each of the sisters and the director takes us along for the ride . I enjoyed the movie as well as the acting . Its not hard to believe Liv and Joaquin actually fell in love during this movie and dated 3 years after ... I recommend checking this movie out if you enjoy any of these actors~you 'll enjoy it ! A+
