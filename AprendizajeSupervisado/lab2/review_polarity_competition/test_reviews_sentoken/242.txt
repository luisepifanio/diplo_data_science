It would be real cozy if Oswald had just been a disturbed individual who did n't get enough love and attention as a child , as in the Peter Gabriel song Family Snapshot , but alas , that might be an over-simplification.Whatever you think about the Conspiracy/No Conspiracy battle , anybody should be able to appreciate this stunning movie , as a movie , which features a performance by Kevin Costner that is basically as good as it gets.I wo n't repeat the rightful praise heaped on the movie by other reviewers , except to say that every good thing you have heard about this masterpiece is true . As for the Conspiracy itself , the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole , it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered . After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner , 'Case Closed ' ( got ta love his arrogance ) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.Personally , I did n't like or trust Kennedy , so I do n't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side . It 's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations . Gerald Posner 's utterly laughable 'explanation ' of the second shot as being a reflex action , in which JFK 's head suddenly jerked backwards , is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex . Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant . He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist , and that 's without including some of the most extreme ( though not ridiculous ) theories.Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art , because thanks to Stone , Costner and a stunning cast , that is what it is .
