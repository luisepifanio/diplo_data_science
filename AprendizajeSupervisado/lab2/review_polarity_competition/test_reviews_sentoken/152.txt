This is a first-rate KILLER DVD release ! It has a superb picture , awesome sound , and lotsa goodies too . But , the real prize is the absolutely wonderful commentary by director John Milius and Arnold . This is hands-down THE BEST EVER commentary you will ever hear ontop of a film ! These guys are having so much fun recalling the making of this film and so will you when you watch it like this ! I may never watch this film without the commentary again ! I was laughing so hard it hurt at times . Arnold is one hilarious dude , and he keeps saying `` exactly '' after literally everything John Milius says . The more he says it , the funnier it gets . This may have the workings of a new drinking game - anyone remember `` Hi Bob '' ? Anyway , BUY THIS DVD , even if you do n't love this film , you 'll LOVE this DVD ! Thanks Arnold & John , ... YOU GUYS RULE !
