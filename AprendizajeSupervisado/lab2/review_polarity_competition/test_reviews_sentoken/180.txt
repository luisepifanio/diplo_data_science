A good deal of scenic travelogue footage fixes the location in this futuristic affair as being an unidentified but exotic Asian island , ipso facto ruled by a villainous technology mogul , Morgan Wells , played in his best deadpan manner by Robert Hays , who has financed development of a preposterous weapon that is engineered to translocate the minds of its outer directed human targets into a permanent condition of virtual reality . Wells ' mistress , Rebecca ( Alexandra Paul ) , weary of his harsh treatment of her , steals a CD-ROM which contains encrypted data requisite for the weapon 's implementation , with the hope of capitalizing her escape and freedom but understands she will not be able to achieve her objective alone , thereby luring naive Jack Morris ( Martin Kemp ) , navigator aboard the tycoon 's yacht , to aid her in her flight . Jack and his Cockney shipmate Manny ( Adam Ant ) have their shore leave interrupted by Rebecca 's plans , particularly so since Morris permits feelings of compassion to bring him into a romantic involvement with the waifish temptress , who induces him into having the stolen data tattooed upon his back within a dragon-like design , and soon Wells and an opposition troupe are literally after Jack 's hide ( the original title was Sailor 's Tattoo ) . The comic book background of scriptor James Robinson is easily visible throughout this low budget film as there is but meagre development of his characters , and neophtye director Erik Fleming is not yet adept in the craft of pacing , but there are scintillas of wit , and savoury acting turns from James Hong and from Hays as a wryly devilish Wells .
