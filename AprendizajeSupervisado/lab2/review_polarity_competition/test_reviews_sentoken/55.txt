For those uniformed potential buyers ... note that the picture/aspect ratio for this specific release has been cropped ( I 've done identical scene comparisons with this deluxe release and the previous edition ) . In addition , the ( 2000 ) release is mislabeled ( i.e . 2.35:1 ) and is actually presented in a 2.55:1 ratio ( the original theatrical release format ) . Conversely , the deluxe edition ( is labeled 2.55:1 ) and because of cropping , has been altered from the picture 's original aspect ratio ... in effect displaying a 2.35:1 image . The cropping issue has also been noted by other various reviewers , therefore confirming and/or lending credibility to this issue not being an isolated event . In summmation ... the product has been misrepresented . With this release , one does not get the complete picture ... literally . I returned my deluxe edtion for a refund and will stay with my ( 2000 ) version , until the studio ( s ) or those responsible for a legitimate `` deluxe '' edtion will `` do it right . ''
