This is not the movie Rosie the Riveter that is so moving about the 4 women who worked in Richmond . It is a dud narrated by a man with some footage from WWII . Do n't buy it . Amazon : be more careful in future about explaining what this is to make sure customers ( like me ) are buying the Rosie the Riveter movie that is better .
