The movie captures the look and feel of Narnia and many scenes are beautifully blocked and filmed . However , the movie 's creators tampered too much with the actual story . This is a flaw not because they `` should '' or `` must '' copy the books exactly ; we all recognize that some creativity may be required to retell a book 's story as a smashingly good movie . This , they failed to do . The ridiculous attempt at a love story between Susan and the Prince was embarassing . And turning Miraz the usurper into the first acceptor of the new land was totally unnecessary and ineffective . News flash : There is a reason these stories have stood the test of time and been read and re-read by children and adults , generation after generation -- they are good stories ! Do n't mess with them unless it 's absolutely necessary and is done effectively .
