Thank you , Andrew Klyde , Paramount and CBS for putting out Bonanza ( finally ) on DVD . I ca n't wait for Volume 2 and so on . These beautifully put together DVD 's are a joy to watch especially since TV Land cuts these episodes up . It 's wonderful to see them again uncut . I recommend Season 1 and Volume 1 of Season 2 for anyone who 's interested in the show , in westerns or just good entertainment . Thank you again and keep the seasons coming . I 'll be first in line to buy each one .
