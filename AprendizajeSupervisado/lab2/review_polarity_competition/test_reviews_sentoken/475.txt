Three things:1 : The `` new '' footage is obviously and distractingly modern . It simply does not fit with the actual footage . The beard on the priest is a very modern cut . A detail like that should never have gotten past the director of the `` new '' footage.2 : The `` actors '' in the new footage are astoundingly bad.3 : The score is horrible . It lacks the tension of the original music.Russo should be ashamed of himself .
