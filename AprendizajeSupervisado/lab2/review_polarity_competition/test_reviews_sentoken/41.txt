BUYERS BEWARE ! ! Any video produced by Alpha is going to be questionable . This DVD produced by this outfit is absolutely horrid . The films jerks and there are points of black outs during scenes in various places . It kept me from otherwise enjoying a fine example of 40 's film noir . The sound varies from clear to distortion at points as well . This would have been a thoroughly enjoyable flicks if they had produced it from a restored master , such as the kind that TCM uses on their network . The movie itself is replete with fine performances , most notably by Edward G. Robinson as a middle aged man trapped in an unhappy married who falls in love with a prostitute played by Joan Bennett . Though I question credibility in his character ... .nobody could be so stupid as to be taken in by this woman unless he was so blinded by love and unhappiness that he failed to see how she was using him . Its a true , haunting portrait of a sad , lonely , frustrated man who becomes Schizophrenic at the end . It is truly a remarkable performance . Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea ( the prostitute and her pimp ) are equally fine in their respective roles . The film is a dark and moody piece but it certainly is in need of a decent film transfer . The DVD here is horrendous . If you can overlook this flaw , you may be able to at least enjoy watching this fine film . Needless to say , other than scene selection , no other extras are included in Alpha 's cheap product which is the reason I give this product ( not the movie ) 2 stars .
