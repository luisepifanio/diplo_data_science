I am one of what seems many people who are unable to watch this video . After several attempts to rent the standard edition and then buying the collector 's edition , I still have not seen this video . I own a 2 year old JVC DVD player . This wo n't even load into my player . The drawer slides in and it ca n't read it . It is only through these reviews that I was able to learn I was n't crazy.Disney merchandising played dumb when I called them ( saying they were not aware of any problem ) , and because it was not bought at a Disney store , they could n't do anything to help me . I am hoping I can get a refund on the DVD , but it is extremely difficult to get anything but another copy of the DVD out of a merchant for an open DVD.Let 's find an email or snail mail address for Disney and write them about how dissatisfied we are about paying $ 30 for a worthless piece of plastic.I wanted to put 0 stars , but that is n't an option !
