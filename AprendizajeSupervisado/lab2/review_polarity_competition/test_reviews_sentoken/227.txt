Kudos to Stanley Donen ! His vision made this film a exhilirating experience , and gave it a heart.It has a superbly creative cast , especially Bob Fosse and Gene Wilder , who played snake and fox respectively . Bob Fosse 's snake looks and moves would be imitated ( and made more popular ) years later by the King of Pop , Michael Jackson . The snake dance is more than enough reason to watch this . Gene Wilder , as the very wise fox , is so endearing . Steven Warner , as the very young prince , is so cute and lovable , you would want to take care of and protect him from all kinds of harm.The music is great , too , especially `` I Never Met A Rose ''
