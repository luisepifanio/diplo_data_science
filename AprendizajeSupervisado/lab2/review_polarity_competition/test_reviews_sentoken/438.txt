An excruciatingly accurate portrayal of the fall of Berlin , this is a historical work of uncanny accuracy and quality . Having read Albert Speer 's account of the Third Reich , `` The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl '' , Stephen Ambrose , John Keegan , Eisenhower , Churchill , Lidell-Hart , and many others , it is readily apparent that `` Downfall '' is the product of meticulous research . At 155 minutes it is a commitment , but surely we can spare the time to look at some of the forces behind the deaths of around fifty to a hundred million people worldwide .
