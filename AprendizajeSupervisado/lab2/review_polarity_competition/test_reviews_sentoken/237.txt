DO N'T BUY THIS DVD - get the CD ! The music is amazing . Mitchell and her world-class backup band create one of the best concert albums ever.The video on the other hand features poor production values . The camera work is amateurish and the editing is awful . Why did Mitchell consent to releasing such sub-standard representation of an amazing concert ? I almost cried when it got to the jam during The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines and saw nothing but crappy shots of the Las Vegas strip.Now , both Jaco and Michael Brecker are gone . This video could have been a great video record of their talents , but no , it 's a cheesy music video that largely ignores the fact that some of the greatest musicians in the world were on stage .
