Though I agree with other reviewers that this DVD seemed more `` advanced '' or `` intermediate '' and also that the voiceover is off at times from the action , I really LOVE this DVD . I really feel like it works -- I 've noticed a big difference in the muscles in my legs after using this program regularly . Also , the program is a nice length . It also stretches my capacities just enough to be challenging , but not so much that I ca n't do it . I really recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a yoga program that pushes them a little harder and is more of a `` workout '' than some others . I also recommend it to people who have some practice with yoga already , not people who are just starting out .
