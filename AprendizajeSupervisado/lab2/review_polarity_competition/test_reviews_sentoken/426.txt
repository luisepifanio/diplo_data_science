as the years go flying by i find myself revisiting alot of my favorite artists whom i have remained faithfull to throughout all these long weird years . joni is one of those artists who 's song writing skills has shown itself to be superior to almost every other writer today-for those not familiar she is also a highly respected painter who 's paintings are getting rave reviews even today and a mitchell orginal comes at a very hefty price tag by the way . this is a wonder concert dvd with joni and her friends playing alot of her biggest hits at the time . all members of this group played wonderfully with alot of enthusiasm and i was especially intranced by her redition of `` shadows and light '' and `` amelia '' , although all the songs were terrific . unlike some reviewers i found the clips to be very interestings and were well blended into the songs and if you pay close attention you will pick up their relevance . a wonderful purchase and very reasonable to obtain a long lasting tribute to one of the great ladies of songs .
