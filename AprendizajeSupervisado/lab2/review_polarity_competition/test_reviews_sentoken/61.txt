Look , going into this you know what you 're getting . It 'll be a pseudo-chick flick in which Jennifer Aniston will be hot ; Gerard Butler will be manly ; the two will be forced to reconcile because of proximity ; and the laughs - as well as the action - will be dwarfed by the attempts to tie everything into a happily ever after bow.Milo Boyd ( Butler ) is a recently fired cop who has taken a job as a bounty hunter . His ex-wife , Nicole Hurley ( Aniston ) , is a pouty journalist who has just skipped a court appearance and jumped bail for a hot story about a potential murder cover-up . Naturally , the paths cross in a soggy Mr. and Mrs. Smith impersonation without the on-screen chemistry . Except Mrs. Smith in this case desperately wants to be with Mr. Smith . And by Mr. Smith I mean Brad Pitt . Hijinks ensue , they reminisce , and yadda yadda yadda.Watch it on an intercontinental flight and at least you 'll pass about two hours . Nothing is really bad , per se , but nothing stands out either . I think I laughed once , and it might have been out of pity . A banal rom-com at best . A better option might be some Tylenol PM and two beers .
