This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a kid . This new two dics CD version with all the color enhancements and additional disc with additional info is fantastic . For a 50 's Sci-Fi flick this is a must to have . The special effects are great and the story and acting are top notch for a Science Fiction movie of this era . If you are collector of the classic Science Fiction add this 50th Anniversary Special Edition of the Forbidden Planet to your collection !
