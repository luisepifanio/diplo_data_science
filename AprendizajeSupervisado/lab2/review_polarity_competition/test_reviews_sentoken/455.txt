The mid to late 80 's spawned hundreds of horror movies of which Hellraiser stands head and shoulders above the competition . Combining stylish , nightmarish imagery with a plot straight from the fetid imagination of English writer Clive Barker it succeeds where so many failed and is a genuine edge-of-the-seat watch . The introduction of the wholely evil Cenobites , led by the charismatic and ruthlessly sadistic Pinhead , was to shape many an imagination and even today the image of a white-faced bald-headed guy whose head is full of builder 's nails embodies the best ( worst ? ) of on-screen horror . This original movie was to prove the basis for a further three spin-offs but none managed to capture the almost tangible sense of real fear that the original movie did so well . Do n't miss it , and if you ever find a gilt-covered puzzle box , for heaven 's sake do n't mess with it ! END
