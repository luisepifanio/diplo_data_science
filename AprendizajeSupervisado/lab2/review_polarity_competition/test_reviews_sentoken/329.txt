30 Days of Night : Dark Days tries to be a woman vampire action film in certain parts . It has dull women both as vampires , and vampire hunters . They are so tedious to watch though . It is filled with impossible , ridiculous and even painful battles in Los Angeles and vampire massacres , many with no explanation since none could be hoped for.The vampire hunting characters , one of whom we recognized as being played by a member of the cast of `` Lost , '' launch poorly conceived or planned attacks on vampires in dark ghettos . They do diametrically reversed and polar opposite things and get into harm 's way so idiotically that you , too , will be quivering then scoffing and finally puking every minute.The acting is terrible , the script is stupid , and the vampires are not even scary . Mia Kirshner is definitely miscast as the evil vampire leader , she 's so boring.If you 're looking for to be frightened , you wo n't really find it in 30 Days of Night : Dark Days .
