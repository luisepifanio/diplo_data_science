This DVD was a severe disappointment ... although it was clearly listed on Amazon as being in the NTSC format it turned to be PAL and therefore unplayable on North American DVD players . I returned it and was sent a replacement which turned out to be the same unusable format . It 's too bad , because I own an earlier DVD in this series by this gentleman and it is excellent ... he is a very good teacher .
