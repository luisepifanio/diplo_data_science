I just recieved my copy today and i already watched this DVD 4 times . Its for anyone that loves REAL hip hop music . This a definate must have for any true Bone fan it has exclusive music and performances with ALL of Bone ( Bizzy included ) You get to see them in the studio recording and performing live and just hanging out this really puts you behind the harmony . thanks Thugline for this GREAT DVD !
