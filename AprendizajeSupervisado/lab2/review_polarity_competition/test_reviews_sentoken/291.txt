This movie has been among my favorites since I first watched it as a kid . The dialogue , pacing , humor , and music has made it a complete package for me . Unfortunately , the remastered version now has new music playing during familiar and popular scenes , causing the tone and mood to be thrown off balance with the rest of the movie . I wish I had known about the new soundtrack before I purchased this edition . While it might work for those just discovering this movie , it falls flat for this fan .
