OK . The soundtrack of this movie is perfect . Powerful , strong , good bands . But , without the music , this movie still would be a great movie . And it 's really simple . Four people . Two couples . Old-fashioned . Hetero . Straight . But it 's enough to show how hard can be to start and build a relationship with someone you like ( or with someone you love ) . I think almost everyone , regardless age , condition or location , can relate with this characters . I guess almost any men had the doubt between to call-not to call some girl after the first date.Besides , the secondary characters are funny , credible , and provide some additional lines.And , a perfect soundtrack ! The DVD also includes the Theatrical Trailer + two outtakes .
