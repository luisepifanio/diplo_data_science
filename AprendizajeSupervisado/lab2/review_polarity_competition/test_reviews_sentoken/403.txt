This is the second copy of this DVD I 've order . The first one was defective and so is this one . I think it might be the recording was not transfered properly to DVD . It 's to bad because it 's a great performance of Miles and Coltrane at the peak of their powers , I 've seen it before . I am gon na try one more time and see if I get a good copy it 's worth it . But 3 strikes an your out ! ! !
