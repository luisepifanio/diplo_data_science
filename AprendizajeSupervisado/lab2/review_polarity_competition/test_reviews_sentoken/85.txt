When the trailers first came out for April Fools Day , they were accompanied by the song & quot ; Momma Told Me Not To Come & quot ; by Three Dog Night . I was n't sure if it was a slasher movie , a comedy , a comedy-slasher movie , or even a frat-party movie . All I knew for sure was that Deborah Foreman ( Valley Girl ) was in it and in the mid-80 's I thought she was so hot you could have cast her in a high school driving safety video and I would have paid admission.Foreman plays Muffy , a rich college kid who invites a bunch of friends to a secluded island owned by her family for a weekend ( an April Fools weekend ) of fun and pranks . The island is only reachable by ferry and this is the last ferry until monday . An accident happens and the kids are shaken . Here is where the mind games start . Not many of the young people know each other . All are supposedly friends of Muffy , but most of them do n't know each other directly . April fools pranks are played non-stop . Dribble glasses , collapsing chairs , and newspaper clippings about dark events . Wait a second ... newspaper clippings ? Is someone playing a joke , or is this real ? There is the hook.Severed heads , rattlenakes , and Muffy 's slow transformation from college beauty to frumpy borderline personality disorder mix evenly with dirty tricks and foolish pranks . What is real ? How much danger is everyone in ? There is no argument that April Fools Day was riding in on the wave of 80 's slasher films , but that is where the similarity to other genre movies ends . You really have to think at this one . They really want to you ask yourself & quot ; is this all a joke ? & quot ; and & quot ; could anyone have actually survived that ? & quot ; I have to give some credit to the music for setting up some great tension . It adds to the feel without taking you out of the moment.If you have not seen this film but you have a friend that has , do n't let them tell you any of it 's dark secrets . Enjoy .
