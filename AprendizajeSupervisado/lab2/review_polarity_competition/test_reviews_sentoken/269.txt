As a fan of 'Gargoyles ' for nearly seven years I am excited to see our beloved 'Gargoyles ' come on DVD after having the release date pushed back on us several times.What may have started out as just another traditional cartoon became a well loved favorite and it has developed a faithful and ever growing fanbase over the years even to this day . For me it took one episode and I was hooked on the show . Then a few years later I rediscovered the show and joined the internet fanbase . 'Gargoyles ' follows a clan of Scottish gargoyles that wake up in modern day New York City after their ancestral home is bought and reassembled atop a New York building while they slept via a magical spell that would only break when the castle rose above the clouds . The clan faces many challenges , including adapting to a new era and their new city they swore to protect and hoping to be accepted by the people of their new city . They meet and make human friends along their way , including NYPD cop Elisa Maza who becomes close with them all , especially their leader Goliath.The show 'Gargoyles ' has something for everyone- mythology , a hint of romance , adventure and even some Shakespeare .
