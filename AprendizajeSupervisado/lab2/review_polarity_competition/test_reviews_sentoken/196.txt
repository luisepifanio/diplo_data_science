I tried this video on my cable 's `` on Demand '' and I will definitely be purchasing it ! There is NO WAY that you can not shape up quickly and completely if you follow this workout ! Jillian ROCKS ! Her combinations keep you moving and working and sweating , but she has a way of making you able to keep up , through both her motivating talk , as well as the way she combines the moves . She has made me a big fan of circuits - you can endure much more ! Her explanations of exactly what muscles you 're targeting REALLY make you motivated to push extra hard , as well as focus on them to really bring on the intensity ! I have been doing the 30 day Shred , which I will continue to alternate with this on days that I can not do an hour , but this is one video I know I will make time for - it is sure to work ! *** Okay I 'm just updating here after 15 days to say that I am actually seeing changes DAILY in my body , and a 6 pack is being revealed . I can hardly believe my eyes ( and trust me , I was a flabby mess , especially my stomach after 2 kids - GROSS ! ) ! I am simply amazed !
