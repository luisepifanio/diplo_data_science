Dean Cain stars as the marshall of an underwater mining facility . He arrests some maniac Russian who later gets out of prison and comes back to get Cain . There 's another plot about people on the facility committing suicide but none of it really matters . If the plot sounds thin to base an entire movie on , you 're right . There was no reason for this movie to be made , it 's basically an ultra low budget rip off of Outland . Since it will cost the you the same at your video store , rent Outland .
