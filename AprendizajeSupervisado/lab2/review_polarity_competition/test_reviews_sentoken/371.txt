If you like Jean Leon and Crismon Rivers , you will adore this film ! Not only do you have action , with a body count , but you also have drama and a real plot , with humor and pathos too . Jean Reno & quot ; the coolest frenchman in the world & quot ; , plays a french officer , with an out of control & quot ; cop rage & quot ; , and a past with special ops . When he is given a manidatory leave , he finds out the love of his life ( who disappeared 19 years ago ) , has passed away , and he must travel to Japan for the reading of the will . From the moment he hits the airport , the action and the plot twists start . The supporting cast is great , and his old special ops friend provides wondeful comic relief . I bought the DVD as soon as it came out , and everyone I have lant it to , has thought it was get . yes it is volient at times , but it can also help you with your golf game ( hint ) .
