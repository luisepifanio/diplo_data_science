To view and relive this cinematic retelling of the astronauts ' odyssey in HD is purely a sight to behold . The space scenes make you feel like you 're really out thre with them . A little grainy sometimes in scenes involving the families of the astronauts or other `` non-space '' stuff , but you have to remember that this film is actually quite old now , so I believe the transfer is as good as can be expected , with little to gripe about . I would have appreciated a Dolby True HD sound track , but the dolby digital plus does the trick for that sonic `` oomph '' you 're looking for . All in all , the film itself excels at what it tries to do . A great film and great HD-DVD material .
