If you can look beyond the usual staccato Mametian dialogue and the uneveness always caused by casting Mamet 's wife Rebecca Pidgeon in the leading female role , then you 've got yourself a very fine movie - probably David Mamet 's best as writer/director in my opinion . I know many people will choose 'House of Games , ' but I thought the 'Prisoner ' storyline was better , and I really like the work turned in by Mamet novices Campbell Scott ( whose combination of brains and naivete drives the film ) , Ben Gazzara and especially Steve Martin , who plays totally against type here.In the Mamet-penned 'Wag the Dog ' we hear over and over again & quot ; It 's a pageant. & quot ; Replace that here with & quot ; It 's a process. & quot ; We hear over and over again about The Process . We never find out what exactly the Process is ( that 's not the point ) , but all actions and reactions in 'Prisoner ' involve securing , stealing and resecuring The Process . It 's a classic Mametian plot device and it works great here . For Mamet fans , there 's a subset of regulars , most notably Mamet house players Ricky Jay and Jerry Graff . [ 'Glengarry Glen Ross ' fans ought to recognize that name . ] Also - be on the lookout for Ed O'Neill for a brief - but memorable - turn as an FBI Team Leader.And keep your eyes on that suitcase .
