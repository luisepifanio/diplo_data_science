I fell asleep ... but i am SO SORRY that i did . This was the most hilarious piece of crap . The only talent anyone appeared to have is mopping the floor ( and even that was done poorly ) . Horrible , HORRIBLE movie . Its one of those things where the first 20 minutes are filled with `` what the heck ? '' the next 20 are filled with laughter and more `` what the heck ? `` , and the remaining time is filled with snoring . I am so so very sorry i paid a dollar to watch this thing . I ca n't even begin to imagine the types of favors people had to do to even get this on DVD , let alone in the redbox-which is where i rented it . THANK HEAVEN i did n't purchase it .
