But I actually really enjoyed this movie ! Despite the only faint resemblance to the original novel ( which I read during my sophomore year of high school and absolutely loved ! ! ) , the occasionally painfully lame dialogue between Bourne and his lady friend , and the Jackie Chan ( I 'm not a fan ) action/fight scenes , this movie had enough brass to keep me interested in the theaters and then over the weekend on DVD . Matt Damon is just a bit young for Jason Bourne , but he was fine . The whole premise is either A ) completely unbelievable or B ) absolutely fascinating -- take your pick . It 's just a movie , so I 'll take B . Remember folks , it 's Hollywood , so do n't get bogged down in reality . . . .Bottom Line : really good performances , the best chase scene in ages ( maybe since The French Connection ) , and the chance to remember a great writer who churned out four or five amazing novels during that stretch of his career . It 's probably only three or four stars on its own , but I 'll jump it up to five in memory of Rober Ludlum . Now I 've got one more book to add to my summer list . . . .
