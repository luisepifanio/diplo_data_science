i have to say , i was disappointed in this follow up to `` 28 Days Later '' .do n't get me wrong , there were some great moments in this movie , particularly the action scenes , which were frenetic and relentless.the problem i found is there were n't enough of these intense scenes.i felt the movie had too many slow spots.i did however like the look of the `` infected '' .they looked much more enraged than in the first movie.the action scenes , when they occurred , were better than the first one , but overall , the movie did not quite meet my expectations.i give `` 28 Weeks Later '' 2.5/5
