Do n't be confused by the name ; there are other , and much better `` The Patriot '' films staring Mel Gibson or Steven Seagal and then there 's Patriot Games staring Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan . In this 1986 movie a former Navy SEAL who was dishonorably discharged , was called back to the Navy to recover a stolen Navy nuclear weapon . It 's not often that I have given less than 3 stars to a military movie ; they are my favorite review . But this film , with Leslie Nielsen as its star is as poorly done as I 've ever reviewed . I tried to like it ; in fact I tried to watch it ! No luck . If you 're like me and in to military movies , the title `` The Patriot '' sound inviting , and it is if it 's the one with Mel Gibson ! ... This poor film of the same name is rated R for a brief sex scene and military violence . ...
