when i was gon na first get the movie i wasnt expecting to really enjoy it that much being that it did not get released in theaters but i wanted it because i do like Stallone movies so i figured i would just check it out . Well i 'm so suprised that it did not get a theater release the movie was 100 times better than i was expecting it to be . It had action , comedy , and romance and i would say Stallone 's best performance since Cop Land . So i just wan na let people know that dont be scared because it didnt get a theatrical release you will be suprised and entertained trust me .
