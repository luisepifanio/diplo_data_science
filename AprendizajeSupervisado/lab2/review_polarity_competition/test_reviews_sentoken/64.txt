All Convoy fans beware-Buy the cheaper version DVD that AMAZON offers and pass the expensive one up . I got so excited after my three week wait when my new DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION of this great movie showed up . I immediatly put it into my DVD player and what do I see after I push play ? A very [ bad ] picture with the sound to match . The picture is bearable but the static you here through the whole movie is not . I just spent [ money ] on a DVD that sounds worse than some of my dusty , old records ... To some it up , awesome trucking movie , definatly add it to your collection-especially if you like good ol ' 70 's flicks . Just do n't buy the SO CALLED DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION ! RATED PG-BRIEF STRONG LANGUAGE , VIOLENCE , BRIEF NUDITY AND PLENTY OF DESTRUCTION ! THIS MOVIE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A PG-13 RATING IN TODAYS STANDARDS .
