Okay , I learned some stuff here . Monkeys that are touched by caretakers are better off than monkeys that are n't . Patrons at libraries rate their experience as better when librarians give them a friendly tap than those who have no physical contact . They even show a 3-year-old tribal African lift up his sibling 's loincloth and playfully smack him on his baby booboo.Still , this work was full of dead time . They spend too long showing consumers testing massaging equipment . They kill time showing a couple in a marriage counseling session . When I watched the series ' episode on taste , I left hungry and so appreciative of good food . I like physical contact with sexy men , but I 'm still indifferent to the taps of librarians . This installation in the series is just thin . I think many people would be horrified if they went deaf or blind , but plenty of people do n't get massages and they feel just fine about life.I once said to a person , `` I could probably live without touch . '' She responded back , `` No . Touch tells you when something is hot or sharp . It keeps you from doing things that could maim or kill you . '' That was an `` Ahhh ! I see ! '' moment . This documentary briefly shows a pottery maker being safe around a kiln , but that life-saving aspect of touch is not really brought up . This is too focused on massages and other unimportant stuff.You may want to actively choose when you watch this installation of the series . If you like to wade through the bad to get to the good , then watch this first . If you believe that `` It 's never as good as the first time , '' then watch this last .
