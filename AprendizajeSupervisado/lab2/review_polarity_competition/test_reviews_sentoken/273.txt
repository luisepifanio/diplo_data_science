A brilliant series that was on for four hilariously funny seasons . Unfortunately , this is what amounts to market tester for sales and we should all hope and pray they release a box set here in the USA like they have just done in the UK ( where all four seasons have been available for years ) . My low rating is only a reflection of my distaste for the owner of the series not putting out the full seasons , otherwise it would be 5 stars .
