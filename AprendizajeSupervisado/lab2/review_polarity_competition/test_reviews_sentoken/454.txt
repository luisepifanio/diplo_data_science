I loved this movie as a child so I thought I 'd buy the DVD . I saw one review about the picture quality being prety bad but I went ahead and bought it anyways . I figured a slightly scratchy print would be better than a used video tape with picture rot.I was not prepaired for how wrong I could be.It basicaly looks like they struck this copy from a mutilated 16mm projector print . The print has bad sprocket damage which causes the image to shake on the screen . It seems like they used the bulb from an easy bake oven to project this print . To call the picture muddy would be a compliment . All the life and color has been sucked out of this film . Did I mention that the film was n't even focused . The sound was pretty bad as well but I 'm not much of an audiophile to realy talk about that.Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version . It ca n't possibly be worse than this copy.Or could it ? : - (
