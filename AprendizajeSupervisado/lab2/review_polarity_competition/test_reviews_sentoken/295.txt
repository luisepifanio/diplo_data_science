I bought Waitress because I 'd heard that it was a feel good movie . A waitress in a pie diner dreams of escaping her jealous , needy husband by winning a pie contest and using the reward money to run away , but her dreams fall apart when she finds out she 's pregnant . She starts an affair with her new doctor and finds happiness . Sounds nice , right ? Well , it really is n't . Both the doctor and waitress are cheating on their spouses in that sort of 'let 's not discuss this because I 'm never leaving my wife ' way . I felt hurt that the waitress 's only happiness came from an affair with a man who did n't love her enough to be with her . The darkness of the affairs , the unwanted pregnancy and a list of other unhappy relationships from the surrounding characters makes you feel defeated . For a happy , feel-good movie you walk away feeling like nothing really ended the right way.I 'd avoid this one unless you approve of unhappy relationships and a plethora of affairs and cheating .
