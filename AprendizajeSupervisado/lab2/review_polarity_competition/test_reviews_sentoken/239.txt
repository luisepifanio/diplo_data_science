... that this is a `` Dawn of DVD '' product . That is , it was one of the first films ever released on DVD . I bought this product when it first came out , so I 've had it for over ten years . Back in 1999 we were just all awestruck by the fact that a movie would fit on something smaller than a brick ( VHS ) and might even have room for and contain a featurette . In this case your extra feature is the featurette `` Right Here in River City : The Making of Meredith Willson 's The Magic Man '' . There are also two trailers , and that is it.Looking at the film today , this disc is a dinosaur . The colors seem runny and the hue a bit off , and the sound is rather uneven . The disc can often be had for a greatly reduced price , and the quality is probably the reason why . This film is ripe for a redo and most probably a Blu-Ray release , so I would save my money until that time , if I was you.As far as the film itself as art , it is one of the great musical motion pictures . I ca n't imagine anyone but Robert Preston as fast-talking fast-thinking Professor Harold Hill , and then there 's my favorite line in the film as spoken by the mayor `` And now I 'd like to present a spectacle - my wife . '' The music is wonderful and memorable , and the whole thing just captures small-town life at the beginning of the twentieth century in such a charming way . I 've liked this film since I was in my 20 's , back when I thought that `` The Terminator '' was classic cinema.In summary , I could n't recommend the film more highly , but as for the DVD I 'd wait until Warner Home Video comes out with an upgraded product . One is long overdue .
