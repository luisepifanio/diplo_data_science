Well , A & E has released the Flying Circus once again , hopefully for good this time , because it is outstanding . Every episode from the show 's four year run is included here . Also in this set are two great new documentaries about the origins of Python and how they became known to America . The Personal Best , although redundant , as has been said before , are here for completion 's sake . ( My favorite introduction being Graham Chapman 's , from one of the sketches : Good Lord , I 'm on film ! ) Now , there are several issues I have with this set.1 ) Only three episodes a disc ? Really ? Dual layer discs nowadays can hold about six , maybe even seven of these episodes ( all thirty minutes . ) I have a suspicion that they were spread out like this on purpose to increase the number of discs , and therefore , run up the price.2 ) The picture , although as good as is available on the Python market today , is abysmal . Every pop , scratch , and dust streak is crystal clear here . It looks as though you were watching the show through a dirty sheet of wax paper . Some episodes are better than others . It depends , really . You can see the show , but the grit is quite noticeable . Other than those , the set is magnificent . The complete show , documentaries , live performances , the one German episode , and the Personal Bests all in one compact , beautifully packaged box with a lid to seal it off . Amazing !
