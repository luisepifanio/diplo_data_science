I loved this movie ! It was great ! Its about this woman named Grace . Her irresponsible husband has just died , and has left her a huge mountain of debt , which she can not pay off . She turns to her gardener for help . She finds one of his beloved hemp plants that he has hidden in the churchyard . She takes it home , puts it in her greenhouse , and starts selling marijuana to help pay off the bills ! What goes on from there is simply hilarious , and you just have to see it ! I highly recommend this film !
