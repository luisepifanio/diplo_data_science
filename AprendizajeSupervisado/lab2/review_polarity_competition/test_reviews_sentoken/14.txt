This review is for the blu-ray version , I had to get it through amazon.ca because they have n't gotten around to a US release yet.The mood set by the pacing , cast , visuals and audio , it is so engrossing ! But my enthusiasm aside , be careful , here are what I consider to be some important considerations when you are preparing to watch it.1 > Watch it ALONE at least once , especially the first time.Also , while we do have a nice home theater system in the living room , I watched this with home theater headphones cranked up to really bring myself into that world.2 > Expectation going in -If you are looking for a movie that spells it out in familiar letters that everyone can see and talk about , you 'll probably be painfully bored.You have to meet this half way , in terms of audience effort its more like a painting than a film . The movie definitely puts you on a suggestive path where the mood , minimal dialogue and situations give plenty of room for your own powers of perception and interpretation to engage , which have hopefully been sharpened by your interests in human nature and history.3 > Energy level and frame of mind -I made the mistake on my first attempt to watch this late at night as a second movie and I had to stop a little less than half way through . So my recommendation is to watch it earlier than later in the night , when you are in one of your more reflective serious moods . And if you are going to indulge in legal intoxicants to 'expand your mind ' , it can enhance the experience , but drink responsibly .
