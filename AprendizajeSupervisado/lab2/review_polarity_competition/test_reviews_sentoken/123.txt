This is a good time . With good actors , a wonderful ensemble cast , lots of nuanced humor , a fun story , and tight editing , this is a movie worth your time.I was a little iffy on it the first time . There is almost too much going on ( and too quickly ) to keep up with . This is not a movie to watch while you are doing something else ( like being on the computer or talking with a friend . ) But the second time , I get all the humor and inside jokes and am watching the facial expressions more closely . There is a lot here to see , and it 's all pretty insightful and funny.The remakes and placement of Partridge Family songs can not be missed . They 're wonderful.The soundtrack on the commentary is off from the movie , as others have mentioned . It 's safe to say the DVDs have this flaw and it 's not just a couple bad DVDs . It 's annoying , but not unwatchable.A wedding seems to be fodder for a lot of movies , and this one makes good use of every opportunity . I may have to purchase this film . Recommended for lots of fun and a couple good belly laughs .
