BGATM is a wonderful low-budget entry from the 60 's heyday of exploitation anything goes insanity ( Horror Of Party Beach , The Flesh Eaters , Brain That Would n't Die ) . Unfortunately three versions of this film exist and all three sport different cuts . One would need all three versions to create a composite of the complete movie . Sadly , the Image disc is missing chunks of footage and is far from the definitive cut of this amusing time capsule . I hope one day somebody will care enough to present this movie in all it 's delightful splendor , but I doubt it .
