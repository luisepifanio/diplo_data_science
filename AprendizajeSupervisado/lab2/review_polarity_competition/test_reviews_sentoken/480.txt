& quot ; Passage to India & quot ; was one of the greatest films produced in the Reagan era . It also happens to be the final film of one of cinema 's most honered craftsmen , Sir David Lean , who is considered by many to be the greatest British director of all-time . This film may not be on the level of his other 70mm epics such as & quot ; Bridge on the River Kwai & quot ; and & quot ; Lawrence of Arabia & quot ; in terms of sweeping scope , but it more than holds its own . Produced in an era where apartheid in South Africa was the hot political issue , this film deals realistically with the occupation of the english in India . Not so much the political occupation , but how the two culture relate to each other through the eyes of the films two lead characters beautifully played by Judy Davis and Victor Banerjee . A film which does not give you the answers , but encourages you to draw your own conclusion in regards to the charcters ( espeically Davis ' Adela Quested ) motivations . Now how does the DVD look ? The transfer is beautiful , the best I 've ever seen this film presented since it opened back in Dec , 1984 . There are no distracting compression artifacts or nasty layer switches . The dolby stereo surround track is clear and ambient with no drop-outs , so a 5.1 upgrade would 've been unnecessary for this film . If you enjoy striking visuals and English literature brought to vivid life through film , Passage is a must-have . My highest recommendation .
