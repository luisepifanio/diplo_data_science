Unlike many of the previous reviewers , I had never seen this concert video before I purchased the DVD a few weeks ago . I have owned the album on vinyl for more than 20 years , and always been curious about the video which accompanied its release , but never had the opportunity to see it.Although it has its ' drawbacks , it was worth the wait to see this . The band is unbelieveable , and all the myth surrounding Jaco Pastorius makes it worth the effort to search this out . Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays are wonderful ( I love the way Lyle throws in that lick from `` Phase Dance '' right in the middle of the opening `` In France They Kiss on Main Street '' ) , and Jaco , well , words ca n't really do Jaco justice . It 's just amazing seeing all this on video - the way the band plays off each other just ca n't be adequately described.Like most of those who have written earlier , my main complaint about this is all of the old movie clips shown with no rhyme or reason throughout the concert . For me , they distracted from instead of adding to the experience.Otherwise , this is mostly excellent . Joni is very loose ( for a self-confessed introvert ) and sure of herself . It 's obvious she 's having a great time . And who would n't , with some of the best musicians in the world backing you up ? Despite the cheessy obviousness of some of the videos , this is still a top-notch DVD . The 5.1 sound is excellent , and even though there are a couple of songs from the album missing , we get a few which are only on the video - Jaco 's solo and nice version of `` Raised on Robbery '' . Good stuff .
