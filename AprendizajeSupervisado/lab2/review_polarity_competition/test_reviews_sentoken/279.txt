This has got to be one of the worst movies I 've seen . Jackie Chan , you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing these movie making idiots to 'use ' your name and images to purposely mislead the public like this.1 . The Title has nothing to do with this movie.2 . The Picture on the DVD box also has nothing to do with this movie.3 . This movie is so far fetched , unrealistic and a total waste of time.The story is about a 16 yr old boy ( present day - again , having nothing to do with the 'historic costumes on the DVD cover ) ... who is bullied at school , and as he idolises Jackie Chan , he wants to become Jackie 's diciple and learn Kung Fu to beat up his school mates.This is rediculous , as any 16 yr old kid would have more brains that to actually follow through with it.What 's more rediculous is that he goes to Beijing to find Jackie ... and everyone in Beijing is 'Oh-so helpful ' to his cause ... During his search for Jackie , he 'traverse ' a few situations that have no relevance what so ever1 . Living in a Monastry with a female Buddhist student who is really a movie actress wannabe.2 . Gets kidnapped by some amateur extorionists.3 . Befriends and saves a police woman , and in doing so , missed meeting Jackie Chan.None of these incidences were ever closed in the plot of the movie.In the end , he gets to meet Jackie who tells him , `` Go home and study ... coz you 're China 's future . `` Do n't waste your time on this movie . I was riding my exercise bike and my eyes were more sore than my thighs after the workout .
