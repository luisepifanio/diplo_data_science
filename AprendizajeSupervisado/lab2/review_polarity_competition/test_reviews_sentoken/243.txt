& quot ; Les Visiteurs & quot ; ( 1993 ) .I saw this film in letterbox format on Showtime Cable in June 1999 . ( The title sequences on the NTSC/VHS version are letterbox , but the bulk of the film is panned and scanned . ) I must have tuned in 10 or 15 minutes after the opening . It is the funniest film I have ever seen . I had to consider whether this could actually be true , because I laughed so hard that I could not always read the subtitles due to my tears ! What I like about this film is its playful absurdity . ( I never liked the & quot ; screwball comedy & quot ; genre until this film . ) The writers and actors seem to have an excellent sense of history , modern as well as medieval and of human nature . The premise is unbelievable , but is presented early in the film . The humanity , in particular the willingness of the characters to learn , to try new things and new language , is very naturally presented . This is what makes the film work . I am reminded of Peter Sellers in his 1979 film & quot ; Being There & quot ; . An unbelievable premise made believable and entertaining by the naturalness of the characters in an unnatural context.This film has profanity and violence which may be inappropriate for younger audiences . It contains medieval French which may produce interesting side effects for students of French who use this film as a motivational study aid ! I understand that a French language only version is available for U.S. ( NTSC ) players and that the 1996 sequel & quot ; Les Visiteurs 2 & quot ; is also available , without subtitles.I also understand that the original cast will remake the film in 2000 entirely in English . Somehow , despite my absent French , I can not imagine how this film could be improved upon . We will see .
