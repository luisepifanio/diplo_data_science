Set in Belgium , this unusual thriller has as its protagonist an anti-hero -- a 57-year old hitman who 's beginning to experience symptoms of Alzheimer 's . His brother , older and residing in a nursing home , has an advanced form of the same disease . But the hitman , Angelo Ledda , has enough of his wits about him to know what 's going on ; he does have some slips in memory from time to time , though , and these throw him off , to some extent at least , in the context of remembering what he 's just done or where he just was -- or who he might have just executed.The acting is superior ; this in combination with a smart storyline with sharp dialogue makes for an engrossing two hours . As is true of many modern noir tales , this one involves corruption in high places , as a result of which murders ensue -- some committed by Ledda , some not.The pacing here is pretty much flawless . The back and forth between the cops , the hitman , and the evil higher-up guys is spot on . This is a great companion piece to the recent French policier `` 36 Quai des Orfevres '' directed by Olivier Marechal which , unfortunately , is not available on DVD here in the US , but is available in a non-region 1 European DVD release.Highly recommended .
