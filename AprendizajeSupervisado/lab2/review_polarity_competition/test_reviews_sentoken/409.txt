Unless your child is at least , perhaps , seven , and has ballet experience , I think this DVD will mostly be frustrating . It attempts to `` teach '' some pretty complex choreography , while posing as a DVD for younger children . It does have some moderately fun warm ups and glimpses into a ballet school , but the majority of it , the dancing , is really far too complicated for little children . This could be simplified and made enjoyable to a wider range of kids .
