StrangeLy still unavailable to DVD in 2009 , THE COMMAND , and KING RICHARD AND THE CRUDSADERS were two of Warner Bros. initial CINEMASCOPE releases from the early to mid-Fifties.With our love of WESTERNS , also the longtime popularity of GUY MADISON as a very personable Actor , it is to be hoped that this strange oversight will shortly be remedied in part , with a welcome release of THE COMMAND.Warners might also consider please , an overdue DVD release of THE CHARGE AT FEATHER RIVER another great GUY MADISON Action-Western.Eric Glasby AUSTRALIA
