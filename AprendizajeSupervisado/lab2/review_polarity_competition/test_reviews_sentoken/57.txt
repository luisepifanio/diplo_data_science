This DVD offers practical step-by-step instructions for organizing a study schedule , getting more out of what you read , and meeting major assignments head-on without procrastination . It 's a study skills course taught by an expert for a fraction of the price you 'd pay in tuition . Whether you 're preparing for college or already have college experience , it will help you learn more , remember more , and stress less . When I applied the principles from this DVD , I got more from my lectures , was able to finish my reading assignments , and often completed writing assignments early . I highly recommend this resource !
