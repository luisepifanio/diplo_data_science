The Italian Job Let 's face it , this movie and this version of it with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is a must for all MINI Cooper owners . It fulfills all the fantasies we enjoy about our grand little cars . The movie is a great romp and never pauses with its cast of wonderful unbelievable characters . Great fun from start to finish.The quality of the DVD itself is excellent . Color , sound and visual detail are outstanding
