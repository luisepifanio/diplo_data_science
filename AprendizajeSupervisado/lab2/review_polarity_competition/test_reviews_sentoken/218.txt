Okay , so if you can get past Glenn Yarborough 's quivery voice , the Orc songs are generally quite amusing . I love the backgrounds ; they are as epic as any scenery in any other animation I have ever seen . The hobbits are well done , Rankin Bass has the best American animation when it comes to detail , and after watching this I ca n't picture a more perfect Gandalf.I do n't know that I 'd let kids watch this ; Tolkein does scary stuff , and the Rankin Bass interpretations stop short of showing people getting hit or skewered , but the monsters are no less scary.Also : Check out Return of the King by these guys ; it 's even better .
