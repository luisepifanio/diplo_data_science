This movie had been on my `` to do '' list for months . I finally watched it yesterday and I am kicking myself for not watching it sooner . This movie was inspiring but it was humorous as well with the cartoon depictions . Joe was truly on a mission to regain his health and he did it . The world should be proud of him . The sad thing about this film was that as he traveled across America and interviewed dozens of people regarding their eating habits , about 80 % if not more just did n't seem to care . The majority knew that their eating habits were bad and needed improvement but at the end of the day , it did n't seem as if enough people were really willing to change . I admire the one guy Phil who called Joe after he had already left America and asked for Joe 's help . Joe actually got back on a plane and returned to the States to help this man ! Nothing could have been more touching . It was awesome to see how he turned his life around and became a new person as did a few others in the film . I am inspired to change my eating habits as well . Let 's face it world . We are what we eat and like it or not we are responsible for about 70 % of our health by what we put in our mouths . The quality of life and great health should not surpass the bad stuff that tastes so good . We must ask ourselves is it really worth it in the end . Yes , I agree that most people who refuse to give up junk food and fast food always say that they are going to die of something so why not die happy ? My theory is what if your life is prolonged and you grow old with all types of health problems and are in and out of hospitals and nursing homes because of what you put in your mouth today ? Who wants long drawn out illnesses that could have been prevented by healthier eating choices ? Hmmmmm ... .makes you think !
