I 'm so thankful for Amazons ' wide variety of things ... I 've been looking for this movie for a few years . It 's one of the best movies i have ever seen , I always choke up at the end . It 's kind of a long movie but the greatest ones are worth it , and i recommend people watching it the 1st time to make sure your focusing on the movie so you can really see everything that goes on . You need to see it if you have n't . And i think it 's great for 12years and older just because its more serious and younger kids might not understand it . But I 'm 16 and I love it !
