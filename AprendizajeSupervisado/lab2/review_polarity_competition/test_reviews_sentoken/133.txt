This hilarious comedy takes the story of the Corsican Brothers and fractures it with two sets of mismatched twins , both played by Donald Sutherland and Gene Wilder , one set raised as the noble brothers , the other as peasants . Throw in the France of Louis XVI just before the revolution and you 've got the setting for this totally screwball comedy.Bud Yorkin & Norman Lear ( of All in the Family ) directed and produced and added a cast of the best English comedians to their two stars , Sutherland & Wilder . This includes : Hugh Griffith as the befuddled King ; Billie Whitelaw as a randy Marie Antoinette ; Victor Spinetti as the reptilian Count Escargot ; Jack MacGowran as the seedy Revolutionary amongst others . Oh , and Ewa Aulin ( she played Candy ) is delicious.When Gene Wilder goes nuts , no one can match him for hilarity . As the arrogant , pigheaded , lightning-tempered Corsican nobleman he is just simply wonderful . Sutherland 's foppish brother is a perfect counterpoint.There is so much good stuff in this that one could go on at length ( the Ball with everyone passing notes of intrigue and the King in his chicken costume is just one ) . Suffice it to say , they threw in the kitchensink with one-liners , references to Dumas and every kind of swashbuckler , non-sequiters , puns etc.A crazy madcap just-for-fun all-out comedy . One of the best ever made . A Classic . See it .
