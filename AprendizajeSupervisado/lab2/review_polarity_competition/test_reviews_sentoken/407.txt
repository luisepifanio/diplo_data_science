And about the ending . I think it 's great ! I like how the Aliens for once are portraited like this . I have seen many movies that have portraited the Aliens in much more hostile ways but not many ( the only other coming to mind is Close Encounters of the third kind ) have portraited them as pieceful . The movie would n't be as good as it is without the ending . What I have noticed about the ending is that people either love it or hate it . Not many think it 's so-so . I 'm one of those who completely loves it !
