Joshua Tree was one of the best action movies of the '90s and Artisan ( who can usually be relied upon to make awesome DVDS ) have given it a terrible transfer.All we get on this very poor and lazy release is a flat and static main menu , Dolby-Surround , a fullscreen trailer and THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN FULLSCREEN . UGH ! This film is supposed to be in 2.35:1 but instead Artisan , for some reason , released it in a mutilated 1.33:1 . This is not right . The directors vision of the film is the one that should be respected and seen by everyone . I advise you to wait for a more definative release of Joshua Tree ( not Army of One ) . Joshua Tree is the REAL title . I really do hope that Artisan change their minds about this DVD and release a better version soon . Widescreen is the most important feature of ANY DVD released . But it is not present here so save your cash for a future release .
