I 've been an admirer of Liam Neeson for several years . I respect how he dares to bring complexity and humanity to nearly every part he does . In this film , these qualities shine brilliantly . Very rarely -- especially in modern films does a writer dare to admit or even suggest that the antagonist or 'baddie ' is still Human . This film 's writer not only suggests it but proves it powerfully via Neeson 's superb performance.Both James and Liam give gripping performances as Little and Griffen . The characters are very credibly done , having emotional and mental wounds . This is not an action piece . For which , I 'm very grateful . Instead , it 's a drama that 's intelligent and challenges the viewer 's perceptions . A 'thinking person 's ' film , if you will . This type of film seems a dying breed so I 'm grateful to have found it . Unlike in Taken , Liam 's char is n't thirsting for revenge ... he is in fact , a traumatized man searching diligently for healing and peace.Whereas Griffen is consumed by hate and pain and believes revenge will give him the satisfaction and solace he longs for . Very human but also very misguided . I do n't think reconciliation actually occurred between Griffen and Little . Instead , I feel an understanding was finally truly achieved which demonstrated one man 's change of heart and caused the other 's . This film is about hope , healing , forgiveness , and redemption . Well executed and I 'll happily own my copy within a few days ! For the reviewer that was so impressed with Liam in Taken , may I suggest Michael Collins ? It 's an action-drama and both Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman are very good in it . Though it 's very gritty and full of language . Yet , if one looks beyond these details to the heart beneath the story is a powerful one .
