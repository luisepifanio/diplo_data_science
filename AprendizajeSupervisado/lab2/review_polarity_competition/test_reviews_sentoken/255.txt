Be careful when purchasing this DVD . If you want the actual US copy you might not get it . I have purchased twice from 2 different sellers and received a Canadian copy of the movie . The Canadian copy has english and french writing on the cover of the movie.The worst part is both of these orders have been fulfilled by Amazon orders.I am trying to buy it a 3rd time today from a private seller , I have asked them if its a US version and they have said yes it is . So hopefullyAmazon has been great about returning the other 2 movies and refunding my money , but its an inconvenience to me having to drive the returns to UPS.Amazon is fulfilling these orders from their warehouse from items they have received from a private seller , so I believe Amazon should verify what they have received before they start shipping the wrong product.Its also fine to sell the Canadian copies but at least they should have their own product page instead of misrepresenting the product.This has happened to me a total of 4 times within 8 months now , I kept the first 2 movies I received , I should'nt have.But with the 2 copies of this movie twice in a row I decided I 'm not settling for the wrong product this time.Maybe Amazon will fix this problem if people start returning products that are not what was advertised .
