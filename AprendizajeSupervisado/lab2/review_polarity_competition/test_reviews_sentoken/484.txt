It is suprisingly nice to see that Hollywood can make a movie that treats same sex relationships as normal and no different than any other . Initially , two young guys , one a musician the other a stripper , are attracted to each other for the same thing everyone desires in a one night stand . The story is their inability to find a place where they can be alone . They search all night through the early morning unsuccessfully , only to find that maybe there is more than just that one night in their interest with each other . Thankfully , this is not your typical main stream movie portraying gay stereotypes . It deals with human values and emotion . It is warm hearted and comical as if you are gay , you will laugh at yourself . If you liked & quot ; Beautiful Thing & quot ; and & quot ; The Sum of Us & quot ; , you will like this movie . Put this one in your library !
