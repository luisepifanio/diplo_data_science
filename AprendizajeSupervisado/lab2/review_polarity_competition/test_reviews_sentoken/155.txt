After looking at all the great reviews this DVD has received , I added it to my 2-year-old 's wishlist , and she got it as a Christmas gift . She loves watching videos and loves the alphabet , so I thought it would be perfect for her . Well , it may be very effective , but it is SO boring , she can barely sit through 2 minutes of it . ( She can make it through full-length Disney movies , unfortunately , so this has nothing to do with her attention span . ) The program consists solely of repetition - animated letters move across the screen as an unseen narrator drones `` A ... A ... A ... '' It 's really painful , and not fun or thought-provoking at all . It 's much more like brainwashing than teaching.If your only goal is for your child to learn the alphabet quickly , this product will probably suit your needs . If you want your child to become a thoughtful , intelligent , well-rounded individual , play with an alphabet puzzle with him , sing the alphabet song , look at books together , and watch something interesting like Sesame Street . My daughter has learned a lot more from Sesame Street 's All-Star Alphabet . Let 's face it - it 's impossible to learn anything from a DVD that never comes out of its box.I gave this DVD two stars instead of one ( or zero ) because if your goals are different than ours , or perhaps if your child is younger , it may be okay for you . It certainly does not meet the needs of our family .
