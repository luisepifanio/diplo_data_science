I saw the movie in the theater but this is a review of the bluray disc . There are features that the regular dvd does n't have , like an extended version of the dance audition ( amazing ! ) , a run-down of all the costumes he would have worn ( my FAVORITE part ! ) and a very emotional tribute of him by the people in the show . The movie itself , of course , was fantastic . But if you are a real MJ fan and have the means to do it , definitely get the bluray . You wo n't be disappointed !
