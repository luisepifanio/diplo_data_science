'Eddie and the Cruisers ' has been my all-time favorite movie since I first watched it back in '83 . I 've seen it dozens of times since then and have worn out two VHS copies . That 's why I was delighted to learn that it was finally being released on DVD , which meant , obviously , a few extras and surprises that the format affords ( widescreen , theatrical trailers , deleted scenes , etc . ) Boy , was I disappointed . First and foremost , it is NOT in the widescreen format , despite what the packaging says . I repeat , THIS IS NOT IN THE WIDESCREEN FORMAT . This is the pan and scan , or full-screen version , with black bars superimposed over it . I ran the DVD simultaneously with the VHS version , freezing frames and comparing . Call me obsessive , but I had to make sure . It was so obvious . Things at the top and bottom of the screen on the VHS version were covered by the bars on the DVD , while the sides of the screen yielded very little extra , if anything , on this so-called widescreen version . As far as the picture itself , the DVD does produce a better quality of this movie than I 've ever seen before . However , that 's the only plus . Since it is not in widescreen , the only extra is one theatrical trailer . No wonder MGM is selling this at below cost . A disgrace and a scam . Unless you just absolutely , positively have to have this movie on DVD , do n't waste your money .
