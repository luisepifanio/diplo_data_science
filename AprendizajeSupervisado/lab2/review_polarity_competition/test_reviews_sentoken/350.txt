Do n't be fooled ! While they have updated the cover art for this film this is nothing more than the same crappy Cheezy Flicks DVD with horrible video and audio , missing scenes included ... If your looking for quality and a complete version get the Kinowelt / Truckerflicks version , it has digitally remastered video and audio as well as the missing footage cut out of the other Convoy releases , the only drawback is the back of the DVD cover is in German but the movie and everything else is in English ... Far worth the extra bucks . Avoid the Cheezy - Cheezy Flicks stuff like the plague !
