After seeing how the cows and other animals are treated on mass production farms , better conditions are needed . Conditions need to get better not only because the current method of production is inhumane , but also we need more more wholesome and safer food.However , grass-fed ribeye steak is currently $ 19.99 - $ 27.99 per pound . How can I afford that ? So there 's a balance between mass production food and price . Nevertheless , I 'll be eating organic grass-fed beef , and if I can only afford grass-fed ground beef , so be it . But we need to vote for healthier and more humane food through our purchases.By the way , most people only think of `` organic '' . There 's a few more things that we need to think about as consumers of food:1 . Organic ( this only means that non-organic pesticides and fertilizers are **reduced** ) 2 . Locally grown3 . Non-GMO4 . Non-irradiated5 . Grass or pasture fed , if meat6 . Country of origin ( food from some countries is allowed to be labelled as `` organic '' based solely on the farmer 's word , without independant third party certification ! )
