There 's a reason that Uwe Boll is called the master of error . Bloodrayne marks Boll 's third video game to film adaptation , and like the ones before it ( House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark ) Bloodrayne is so bad that you have to see it to believe it . Kristanna Loken , best known for being hot and playing the TX in Terminator 3 , stars as the vampire heroine in this incoherent mess , which for some odd reason also features Oscar winner Ben Kingsley as the evil Kagan . The plot is the typical humans VS vamps deal , but the single most intriguing aspect of Bloodrayne is just how did Boll manage to get these actors in this film ? It 's mind boggling how Kinglsey , Michael Madsen , Michelle Rodriguez , and Billy Zane all ended up in this , all of which spewing some of the most terrible dialogue you 'll ever hear . Occasionally the action and gore are decent enough , but Bloodrayne is best enjoyed as an unintentional comedy . Also featuring Matt Davis , Meat Loaf , Boll favorite Will Sanderson , and genre stalwart Udo Kier .
