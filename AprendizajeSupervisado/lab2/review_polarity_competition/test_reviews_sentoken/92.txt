Director Terry Jones allowed his son to do the editing for the DVD 's version , and -- as you see by all the 1-star reviews -- the job he did was horrific . It was butchery . Key scenes and lines just tossed out . This should have been reviewed by someone at the studios . Someone who could have uttered MY scream of outrage for me , before it would have been too late.Get the old VHS . Skip the DVD . Really .
