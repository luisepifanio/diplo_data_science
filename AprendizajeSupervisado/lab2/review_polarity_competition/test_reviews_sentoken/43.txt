I recently watched & quot ; The Odd Couple & quot ; for the first time in about twenty years . What a thrill to see Felix and Oscar going at it . At one of the film 's most touching moments , near the beginning , Felix , preparing to do himself in by jumping out the window of a flea-bag hotel , walks sullenly toward his rented room . A haggard cleaning lady in the hall greets him , saying & quot ; Goodnight ! & quot ; His key in the door of the room , he looks back and says & quot ; Goodbye & quot ; . A magic moment . And there are so many others in this film . Felix 's sinus attack in the restaurant competes with Meg Ryan 's & quot ; orgasm & quot ; scene with Billy Crystal for & quot ; funniest moment in a movie restaurant scene & quot ; . Watch this film and enjoy it again and again . I certainly did !
