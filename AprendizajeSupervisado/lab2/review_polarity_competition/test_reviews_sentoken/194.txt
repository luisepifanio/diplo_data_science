I think that the other reviewer below , Patrick B. Dandenault , was completely right in his guess of the story . The later part of the movie is imagination of Fred while he sits in his cell waiting for his execution . The screaming and smoke in the car at the very end of the movie when Fred is escaping police chase actually represent the execution at the electricity chair.This is a true masterpiece . Just do n't try to understand everything and let it go . Lynch 's movies are conceived and interpreted at a subconcious level.The closest masterpieces are `` Mulholland Drive '' , `` Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me '' ( however makes sense only if you watched Twin Peaks ) and `` Fight Club '' ( by David Fincher ) . I saw a recommendation on Amazon about Memento and bought it , but I would rate that only 3 stars .
