I loved Sansone 's 15 minute-one mile walk video so much that I 've decided to go for the 30 minute-two-mile walk . Although Sansone 's attitude and personality are very motivating , I found that the music was a bit ( just a bit ) disappointing to my taste . Also , a few of the movements were not so impressive . Overall , it 's a good video tape , and I 'm glad that I found Sansone through amazon.com .
