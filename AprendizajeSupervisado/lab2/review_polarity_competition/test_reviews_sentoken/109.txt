Here is a description of the Lessons on this DVD : Part 1 : The Family Reunion Pronouns The American Manual Alphabet Occupations Part 2 : Saturday at Home ( vocabulary of rooms in house and a bunch of verbs ) Prepositions Part 3 : The Doctor 's Appointment Parts of a Sign Part 4 : The Picnic Signs for the Weather Time of Day Part 5 : Our Vacation Plurals Time Calendar I am a beginner in sign language . This DVD is really the only & quot ; lesson & quot ; I 've had in sign language . This program is great ! It is jam-packed with vocabulary - they teach you around 800 signs ! The content and lessons are very well organized and structured . The host of the show is a deaf woman signing ASL . The co-host is a man signing in English grammar structure . I love it that just about everyone on this DVD signs every word they speak . The host signs as a background voice translates for the viewer . This way you pick up more words as you watch the lessons over and over ; you also get to see people interacting in sign language , putting it all together , instead of just learning a bunch of signs . Everyone signs at normal signing speed , so at first it is overwhelming . But as I have watched the program over and over , I can now pick out a lot of what they are signing . I only noticed two drawbacks of this program . One , the speed at which they sign the signs they are teaching you . I had to rewind a few times for the more complex ones . Two , during a couple of the skits the person & quot ; learning & quot ; signs from the deaf person did n't sign the exact same way . They did it backwards or with a different hand . I 'm totally new to ASL , so I do n't know how much precision is expected . It is confusing for a beginner either way . Despite the two small drawbacks , I give this program 5 stars . I am definitely buying the second volume !
