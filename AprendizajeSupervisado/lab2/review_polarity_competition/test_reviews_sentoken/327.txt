It 's basically a two hour long chase across country with murders along the way . They call it a `` modern western '' because hat color does n't correlate with integrity . The main characters commit atrocities , but you 're supposed to identify with them at different times because they can be rationalized as `` victims . '' There is a bizarre point where Angelica Huston materializes and the moviemakers seem to be striving for some kind of morality play . Just when you expect a dramatic twist and final conflict resolution , the characters turn indecisive and the movie ends . It 's really weird . I have seen movies fizzle before , but this one really fizzles ! I will say however that the chase is engaging , for the first hour at least .
