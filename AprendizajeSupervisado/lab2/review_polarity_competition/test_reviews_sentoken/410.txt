This film was a surprise gem , a gift from the Independent film Channel . My son and I watched it with my sister and enjoyed every bit of it . The characters were real , funny , genuine , warm , and down right sexy . It was fun to see Alexis in something besides drag . What more can one ask for than a happy ending . Ah , love . Hey , wait , what about me ?
