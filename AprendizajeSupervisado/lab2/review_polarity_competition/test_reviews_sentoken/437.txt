While I agree with the previous reviewer about the overall summary of this film in general , the transfer is extra hazy , even for Alpha and being a 1932 film . This is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen from the company . This is a British print of the American made movie . Very distracting buzzing throughout as occurs with some other Alpha titles , even to the point where it distorts the actor 's voices a couple of times . People , Beware of this print ! Do n't waste your money ! P.S . I do n't know anything about the `` new '' Tapeworm company version . I have never before heard of the Tapeworm company , so buy at your own risk .
