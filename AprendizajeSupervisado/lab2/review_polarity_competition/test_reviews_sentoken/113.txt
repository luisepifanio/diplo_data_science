This is not a review , but rather a word or two about the terrible problems with the sound synchronisation.The film itself is one of the greats in the genre of crime thriller , and so it is a criminal shame that Criterion have released the film with a French soundtrack well and truly out of synch with the action.However - there are NO , repeat , NO - such problems with the English language ( dubbed ) soundtrack ! So - you have the choice of either suffering the sound problems ( but getting the original language and thus a better psychological ambience ) or suffering the dubbed English ( but having the sound effects in synch ) .Either way , if you are a devotee of films , or just heist movies , this is a Must-Have ! The DVD would score five stars if Criterion ever get around to releasing it with the sound problems fixed ...
