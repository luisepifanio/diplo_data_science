This series adapts the six lengthy `` Palliser '' novels by Anthony Trollope into 26 episodes of delight and intrigue in Victorian England . Susan Hampshire 's Lady Glencora is without doubt the center of this series . Forced into a marriage with the wealthy but distracted Plantagenet Palliser , who seems far more interested in becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer than in his marriage , Lady Glencora must balance her relationship with her husband against that with another man , whom she has truly loved . Watching as the two Pallisers adjust their relationship to find their love is an absolute delight . But this story is more than just the Pallisers . As the six lengthy novels are boiled down to 26 episodes ( 8 in the first set ) , we meet Phineas Finn , an Irish MP who is the title character of two of the books -- one deemed a fine political novel , the other a suspenseful masterpiece . Both are well incorporated into the series . Barbara Murray amazes as Madame Max Goesler , a wealthy widow who interacts with the aristocratic Pallisers without ever letting her great good sense be overwhelmed by the privilege of associating with the creme de la creme . Six novels boiled into a series requires a great ensemble cast , and one is provided . Such noted British TV actors as Derek Jacobi ( later of I , Claudius ) and Penelope Keith ( of To the Manor Born ) play small but important parts as the foppish Lord Fawn and his sister . But in the final analysis , it all comes back to the relationship between Hampshire 's Lady Glencora and Philip Latham 's Plantagenet . Well worth watching .
