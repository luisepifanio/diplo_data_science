I 've never played the game before but I knew of it and told myself I had to see this movie , especially because of the great cast . I had no idea what I was getting into and I wish I could get my money back for renting this DVD . One major blowup about this flick is that the fight sequences are way too sloppy and slow . You would think that nobody in this movie had training because everybody 's out of shape and off on the fight choreography . There 's no good soundtrack and the music they do play is boring . Now one thing that happened that I never thought was that every actor was terrible . It felt like they came to the set after the real movie they were filming and they were dead tired . I am warning anyone interested in seeing this movie to stay away , just do n't cause you 'll be mad .
