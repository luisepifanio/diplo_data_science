I am a devoted fan of Ally Mcbeal and watched all the episodes on tv . Still , I would like to see the entire seasons released in full . I 've heard they 're available in Europe and I see the complete first season of 'Friends ' is soon to be released . So why not Ally Mcbeal ? This Ally Mcbeal boxed set is great but there should be more . I want the entire seasons on vhs . I 'm sure my fellow Ally Mcbeal fans feel the same way .
