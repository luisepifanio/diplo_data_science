This is a fake documentary that 's actually a scripted movie using professional actors.It purports to follow a couple of 'underground fighters ' who take part in no-holds barred tournaments that are produced by the owners of an internet gambling website . Interviews with people involved in boxing , including Larry Holmes and Bert Sugar , are interspersed with the scripted 'fake ' parts of this film in an attempt to fool the audience into thinking this is the real deal.However , the actors soon give away the secret ; especially the supposed 16-year old street kid whose good looks , perfect teeth , and obviously scripted stream-of-conciousness dialogue make it apparent that this is not an actual documentary.At the end , as the credits roll , it is finally acknowledged that this is fake.I do n't have a very high opinion of this movie . The fighting is boring , barely visible due to the near-dark conditions under which it was filmed , and unrealistic ( no weight classes and no gloves , just to name two obvious giveaways ) . The dialogue does nothing to enlighten us , only bore us with its banality . In short , the purpose of this movie is to deceive the audience , then shout , `` A-Ha ! ! ! '' at the end . A movie that aims to make its audience feel like fools is n't enjoyable to watch .
