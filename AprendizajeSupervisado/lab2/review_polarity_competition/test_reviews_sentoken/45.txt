Holy cow . I heard that this movie was n't good , but I had no idea just how bad it was . I 've seen these actors in other things and am not sure whether I am more shocked that they agreed to this script or that they agreed to act this poorly . I think it says something when the best performance was given by Meat Loaf . Yes , that is `` Paradise by the Dashboard Lights '' Meat Loaf , and it is a shame that his roll was so small . ( I ca n't believe I just typed that ) . The draining of the victim from vampire bit CGI effect is pretty good , but from now on , I am sticking to the video games .
