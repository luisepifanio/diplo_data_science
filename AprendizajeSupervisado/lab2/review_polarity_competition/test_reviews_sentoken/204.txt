` Matchstick Men ' is one of those movies that makes you realize why some actors have support . Up until watching this film I had been a ` Cage-Hater ' , a guy who just could n't wrap his head around all the critical support ( granted , I saw this movie before watching ` Adaptation ' and since watching that film I 've realized this man ` can ' act , he just chooses not to half the time ) . Here though Nicolas Cage gave me a brief glimpse of the man that everyone else sees . As con-artist Roy Waller , Cage gives us a brilliant performance.My main problem with Cage has been his stiff natured acting , the fact that every time he speaks it feels as if he 's reading a prompter card , and so I think that the fact that his character here suffers from a severe case of OCD ( obsessive compulsive disorder ) helps a lot in that regard since he 's supposed to sound stiff and unnatural.Roy works with fellow con Frank ( Sam Rockwell ) , the young hotshot prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; who has higher ambitions than Roy himself , and this is causing them to butt-heads a bit . The real drama though comes in the form of Angela ( Alison Lohman ) , a young 14-year old who claims to be his daughter . At first Roy 's put off and distant , but after Angela shows major interest in her fathers line of ` work ' they begin to bond by pulling small con-jobs together . Meanwhile Frank is getting more and more agitated with the new bond between father and daughter because it 's causing a strain on a big job they have coming up.Filled with twists and turns and an ending I never saw coming , ` Matchstick Men ' is the perfect kind of caper . It 's got great acting from a cast I never knew had it in them and a great moral message that manifests itself as the film unravels . Alison Lohman is charming and natural and Sam Rockwell is the perfect side-kick , but the real shocker ( at least to me ) was the mere fact that Nicolas Cage steals the show from everyone !
