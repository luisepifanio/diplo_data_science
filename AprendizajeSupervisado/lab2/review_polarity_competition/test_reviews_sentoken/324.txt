Let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of The Hobbit by Rankin/Bass . I own it on VHS and have watched it over 100 times . It ranks among my favorites of all time . That 's the VHS version . Now let 's talk about the DVD version . It [ is not good ] ! Buy The Hobbit on VHS but avoid the DVD version . How can this be you ask ? Let me answer that by quoting the letter I wrote to Warner Bros about the DVD : '' Dear Sir or Madam : '' I have been a huge fan of the Rankin/Bass production of `` The Hobbit '' since it was first shown on television in 1977 . As soon as it was available on VHS , I bought it . I have watched it well over 100 times . I know every word of dialog and every bit of the music . It ranks among the very best animated films ever . `` So imagine my delight when I learned that it was available on DVD - finally ! ... I bought the DVD anyway ( after a long wait and a lot of pondering ) in hopes that perhaps the problems had been addressed in a newer version . Much to my dismay , the problems are even worse than the reviewer lead me to believe . It sounds to me like the original sound-effects track is completely missing . To compound such an egregious omission , new sound effects have been plopped in that do not remotely mesh with the original soundtrack . `` This is outlandish ! This is not just incomprehensible but reprehensible ! I can not possibly express to you the degree of disappointment , nay anger , I feel over this . You can not possibly have a valid reason for such foolishness . At the absolute least , you should have simply released an unchanged version of this excellent film on DVD with some attempt at enhancing the image and sound quality . `` I was eagerly awaiting the DVD release of `` The Hobbit . '' I am incensed , ... To sum up : I love the movie ( 5 stars ) . Get it on VHS ( 5 stars ) . Avoid the DVD version like the plague .
