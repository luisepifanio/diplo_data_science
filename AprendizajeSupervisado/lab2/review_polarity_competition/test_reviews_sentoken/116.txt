If you love nature programs you will love this one . It was filmed in the national panda reserve in the & quot ; Mountains of the Sleeping Dragon & quot ; in China . It features one of the most endangered animal in the planet , the giant panda . There are over 100 of these animals in the area but their habitat is shrinking due to human encroachment . It is hard for them to find mates and enough food to survive . The panda must eat half their weight in bamboo every day to survive because it is so low in nutrients . The program shows a pair of giant pandas mating . They also show a successful birth to a baby giant panda cub . The program also shows footage of the rare red panda and a bamboo rat mother and her babies who also eat bamboo . I particularly enjoyed the footage of a salamander that can grow to six feet in length . It lives in the streams of the area . It was very short but very interesting . I highly recommend this program .
