I read the book before I saw the movie . I am a committed , and devout catholic Christian also , but I never read the book or saw the movie as anything more than exciting fiction ... I think all the bashing and alarmismfrom the religious right was `` overblown by the media and many in the Christian community who gladly mined the book and movie themselves for profits ... ( witness all the `` anti-DaVinci '' books , movies and audio tapes . ) If you are SECURE in your faith the book and film should not affect you.It did n't for me ... it actually led me to read more of the Bible and the patristic fathers of the Church . As for the film , well , the book was probably one of the `` best '' I 've ever read . I expected to be disappointed by the movie , but `` was not '' .I thought Tom Hanks and the Cast were GREAT . Do n't miss it ! Unless of course , you feel it is offensive ... As thinking adults we can and should all decide that for ourselves . Atreides
