When it comes to Chushingura ( this version ) , I 've read a few things . First , this is from all accounts a very , very good movie ( maybe even great ) . It may be long , and not exactly fast paced , but it is a very well made movie from every comment I 've come across.Second , and this is the most important part as related to the DVD , the transfer and mastering job that Image did on this release is terrible . It 's non-anamorphic , and non-progressive ( so the interlaced scan lines are prominently seen when there is motion on screen ) . There are other gripes about the transfer as well , but those two are the big ones.Ten years after the release of this DVD it 's time for a Special Edition - with a reworked anamorphic , progressive transfer . Whether Image does it themselves , or they sell the rights to someone else ( or just let them lapse so Criterion can pick them up ) , this movie deserves MUCH better treatment than it got here.I 'll buy it as soon as a better DVD is released .
