The first time I saw this movie I was already a Sellers fan . What I liked most was that Sellers talent did not go to waste on meaningless chatter ... .just 100 % PURE Sellers at his best ! I purchased the movie at the same time I bought my first DVD player ! Better than all of the Pink Panther movies !
