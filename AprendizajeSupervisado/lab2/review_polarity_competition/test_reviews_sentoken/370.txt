It is my understanding that Holly Hunter never met Wanda Holloway before she made this movie . If that was true , then she deserves every award she gets . Her portrayal of Wanda was TOP NOTCH ! I went to Channelview High School with Wanda , Terry and Tony Harper . If you watch this movie for no other reason than Miss Hunters performance , you will not be unsatisfied . Of course , Hollywood made everyone else look like a cartoon.As fine an actor as Beau Bridges is , no one could do justice to a character like Terry Harper.This is NOT a documentary , folks !
