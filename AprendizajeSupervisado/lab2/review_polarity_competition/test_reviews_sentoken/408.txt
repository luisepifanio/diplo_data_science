I had read mixed reviews of The Limey and could not figure out the reason . Once I viewed the film on DVD it became clear exactly why some were put off by this simple tale of revenge . From the beginning the plot and the visuals are very jumpy and non-linear . As the film progresses , everything become linear and very clear . This device is used to express the confusion and blind rage of a father which transforms into sadness with a feeling of closure . As usual Soderbergh creates a visually dazzling film with rock-solid actors . One can see a progression from & quot ; The Underneath & quot ; to & quot ; Out of Sight & quot ; to & quot ; The Limey & quot ; . The genre of film noir in broad daylight seems to be uniquely his . I recommend this to the art-house crowd more than I would people looking for a straight actioneer .
