Diva is one of my favorite international movies with spectacular surrealistic cinematography and French-style action mixed with beautiful bel canto singing . Unfortunately , the producers of the DVD version of the movie really did n't know what they were doing on the audio track which is mono and seems to suffer from severe compression and distortion effects . The effect is that the sound track sounds muffled and occasionally even drops out altogether . Unfortunately , the audio quality is so bad that it really ruins the movie , and ultimately makes one want to fast-forward through Wilhelmenia Fern & aacute ; ndez 's beautiful singing . What a shame.Therefore , although I highly recommend the movie , I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD . Perhaps the video version or French-only release is better .
