Stanley Kubrick should be applauded for -- in what is perhaps the first instance of a Hollywood movie -- accurately portraying the American conscience in Vietnam . Forget the paper-thin morality and hidden propaganda of `` Platoon , & quot ; and the chest-thumping testosterone of such laughingly bad portrayals as `` The Green Berets & quot ; ; Mr. Kubrick shows us the real Vietnam : from the dehumanization of boot camp to the sporadic deaths of comrades in battle.Essentially , this is two films in one . The first half dealing with new recruits adjusting to military life ; the second with actual combat . Many will tell you the latter does n't live up to the former , do not believe them . Mr. Kubrick delivers an incredibly accurate depiction of Vietnam warfare.Unfortunately , I had to take a star off this otherwise perfect movie because the DVD transfer is quite bad .
