I was already working out regularly , trail running and swimming , so was very surprised how sore my thighs were after doing the 10-minute thigh sculpt segment ! Great workout & leaders who walk you through it are very likeable & easy to follow . Time for the 5 segments flies by and I like having possibility of doing shorter workouts when I have less time . I alternate it with Lotte Berke Muscle Eats Fat .
