_The Princess and the Warrior_ offers great characters , an interesting story line , and great cinematography and direction . Like many others , I saw _Run Lola Run_ first , and liked it very much . This film had more character development and seems to be a more introspective and philosophical than Lola . Potente carries the film with her portrayal of a sanitorium nurse , Sissi . She is a strong lead and can show a great range of emotions . The character of Bodo Riemer , played by F & uuml ; hrmann , also gave a great performance as an ex-soldier who is recovering from the death of his wife . He is emotionally distant , and has fallen into a life of crime . A freak accident brings the two together , and Bodo ends up saving Sissi 's life . After Sissi 's long recovery , she sets out to find Bodo , believing that they are meant to be together . Bodo can not move on from his past , and Sissi is rejected many times . This movie is not a typical boy-meets-girl romance , rather , it is about fate , and how things can change in a split second . I highly recommend this film !
