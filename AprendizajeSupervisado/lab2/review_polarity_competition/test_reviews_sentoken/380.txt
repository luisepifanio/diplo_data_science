Bought this believing it would be recorded correctly . They just took the 2003 non-anamorphic DVD and put a cardboard with a hologram on top that says 2007 , that 's all . Once opened , you can not return these . I 'll throw it away I guess ... is there a phone number to complain ? Ca n't find one ...
