But what I got was pure crap.Splice is about a relationship-stupid couple who were played by the great Adrien Brody and the incredibly annoying Sarah Polley . They 're both brilliant genetic researchers who were on the break of fame for creating two genetically spliced creatures named Ginger and Fred that were the products of DNA from a multitude of organisms . What a fricken great idea ; an idea that is explored in many great novels , movies , videogames , etc. , and the idea in Splice falls extremely short of great . Well , to complicate the story , Sarah Polley injects human DNA into the same sort of organic base that Fred and Ginger were created from . . . and of course the organism would turn out to be humanoid . . . At this point there 's potential for a great Frankenstein-esque tale . . . But no , it just turns into a sick , demented , bestiality , incest tale with no climax , no imagination , and with no likeable characters.I can not recommend this film as a good science fiction-horror ; I can almost recommend this film as a decent softcore-bestiality with a hint of incest at the end . That 's not my kind of movie ; is it your kind of movie ? Maybe .
