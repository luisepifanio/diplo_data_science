`` This one '' refers to the [ supposedly ] remastered DVD edition of A2zcds . I just bought it and IT IS AWFUL ! Ditto for the soundtrack . The picture quality is equal to that of a bad video . Dark and murky and full of `` moth holes '' . [ Large white spots , commonly referred to as snow ] . For the first 40 minutes or so , it was hard to figure out what was going on , or who was who , as the picture was so bad that one just could n't see , never mind make out details . On top of that , lovely Geraldine Brooks was very unfavourable photographed and Glenn Ford looked as though he had n't slept for days . [ Which may not be that far from the truth -- ] . During the lengthy chase scene up the mountain side at the end , it is so dark that you just have to guess what 's going on . And naturally , one thinks it is night time . But no , suddenly we 're in broad daylight . Or maybe the moon came up real bright or something . But by that time you do n't care anymore , since the whole thing is a mess anyway . Aside from the technical flaws , the scrip leaves a lot to be desired also . It is all over the place and utterly confusing.Should you still want to buy this DVD , there are 3 photographs on the back of the box the disc comes in . In one photo one can just barely make out who 's on it . The other two are just black , or nearly so . That will give you a pretty good idea of what the movie is like.Well , you win some , you lose some . And this one is a dead loss . A waste of time and money .
